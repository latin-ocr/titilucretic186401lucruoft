induperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,

nautae contractum cum ventis degere bellum,

nos agere hoc autem et naturam quaerere rerum

cetera sic studia atque artes plerumque videntur

in somnis animos hominum frustrata tenere.

et quicumque dies multos ex ordine ludis

adsiduas dederunt operaS, plerumque videmuS,
