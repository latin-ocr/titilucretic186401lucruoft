quantula priva queant nobis iniecta ciere
corpora sensiferos motus in corpore, tanta
intervalla tenere exordia priva animai. 380
nam neque pulveris interdum sentimus adhaesum
corpore nec membris incussam sidere cretam,
nec nebulam noctu neque aranei tenvia fila
obvia sentimUS, quando obretimur euntes
nec supera caput eiusdem cecidisse vietam 385
Vestem nec plumas avium papposque volantis
qui nimia levitate cadunt plerumque gravatim,
nec repentis itum cuiusviscumque animantis
sentimus nec priva pedum vestigia quaeque,
corpore quae in nostro culices et cetera ponunt. 390
usque adeo prius est in nobis multa ciendum

concursare coire et dissultare vicissim. 395

sed comes insequitur facile et discedit in auras 400
et gelidos artus in leti frigore linquit.

at times we do not feel the adhesion of dust when it settles on our body,
nor the impact of chalk when it settles on our limbs, nor do we feel
a mist at night nor a spider's slender threads as they come against us,
when we are caught in its meshes in moving along, nor the same insect’s
fljmsy web when it has fallen on our head, nor the feathers of birds and
down of plants as it fiies about, which commonly from exceeding light-
ness does not lightly fall, nor do we feel the tread of every creeping
creature whatsoever nor each particular footprint which gnats and the
like stamp on our body. So invariably must many seeds mixed up
111 our bodies throughout our frames be set in motion ere the first-
bcginnings of the soul are roused to feel, and ere by thumping with such
spaces between they can clash unite and in turn recoil.

The mind has more to do with holding the fastnesses of life and has
more sovereign sway over it than the power of the soul. For without
the understanding and the mind no part of the soul can maintain itself
in the frame the smallest fraction ‘of time, but follows at once in the
other's train and passes away into the air and leaves the cold limbs in
