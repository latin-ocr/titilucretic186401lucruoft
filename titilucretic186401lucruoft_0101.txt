cum facere instituaS, cum primis quaerere par est,
quoad licet ac possis reperire, inolentis olivi 850
naturam, nullam quae mittat naribus auram,

quam minime ut possit mixtos in corpore odores
concoctosque suo contractans perdere vir0,

propter eandem rem debent primordia rerum

non adhibere suum gignundis rebus odorem 855
nec sonitum, quoniam nil ab se mittere possunt,

nec simili ratione saporem denique quemquam

nec frigus neque item calidum tepidumque vaporem,
cetera, quae cum ita sunt tamen ut mortalia constent,
molli lenta, fragosa putri, cava corpore ram, 860
omnia sint a principiis seiuncta necessest,

inmortalia si volumus subiungere rebus

fundamenta quibus nitatur summa salutis3

ne tibi res redeant ad nilum funditus omnes

Nunc ea quae sentire videmus cumque necessest 865
ex insensilibus tamen omnia confiteare
principiis constare. neque.id manufesta refutant
nec contra pugnant, in promptu cognita quae sunt,
sed magis ipsa manu ducunt et credere cogunt
ex insensilibus quod dieo, animalia gigni. 870

scent like nectar, before all you should seek, so far as you may and can
find it, the substance of scentless oil, such as gives out no perfume to
the nostrils, that it may as little as possible meddle with and destroy
by its own pungency the odours mixed in its body and boiled up with
it 3 for the same reason the first-beginnings of things must not bring to
the begetting of things a *smell or sound of their own, since they can-
not discharge anything from themselves, and for the same reason no
taste either nor cold nor any heat moderate or violent, and the like.
For as these things, be they what they may, are still liable to death,
whether pliant with a soft, brittle with a crumbling, or hollow with a
porous body, they must all be withdrawn from the first-beginnings, if
we wish to assign to things imperishable foundations for the whole sum
of existence to rest upon: that you may not have things returning
altogether to nothing.

To come to another point, whatever things we perceive to have
sense, you must yet admit to be all composed of senseless first-begin-
nings: manifest tokens which are open to all to apprehend, so far
,from refuting or contradicting, do rather themselves take us by the hand
and constrain us to believe that, as I say, living things are begotten
