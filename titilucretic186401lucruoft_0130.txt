tertius accipiat quaedam clementius aequo,
inque aliis rebus multis differre necessest
naturas hominum varias moresque sequacis; 315
quorum ego nunc nequeo caecas exponere causas
nec reperire figurarum tot nomina quot sunt
principiis, unde haec oritur variantia rerum.
illud in his rebus videor firmare potesse,
usque adeo naturarum vestigia linqui 320
parvola quae nequeat ratio depellere nobis,
ut nil inpediat dignam dis degere vitam.
Haec igitur natura tenetur corpore ab omni
ipsaque corporis est custos et causa salutis3
nam communibus inter se radicibus haerent 325
nec sine pernicie divelli posse videntur.

than is right. In many other points there must be differences between
the varied natures of men and the tempers which follow upon these3
though at present I am unable to set forth the hidden causes of these or
to find. names enough for the different shapes which belong to the first-
beginnings from which arises this diversity of things. What herein I
think I may affirm is this: traces of the different natures left behind,
which reason is unable to expel from us are so exceedingly slight that
there is nothing to hindei· us from living a life worthy of gods.

Well this nature is contained by the whole body and is in turn the
body's guardian and the cause of its existence 3 for the two adhere
together with common roots and cannot it is plain be riven asunder
without destruction. Even as it is not easy to pluck the perfume out of
lumps of frankincense without quite destroying its nature as well 3 so it
is not easy to withdraw from the whole body the nature of the mind
and soul without dissolving all alike. With principles so interlaced
from the beginning of their existence are they formed and gifted with a
life of joint partnership, and it is plain that the faculty of the body and
of the mind cannot feel separately‚ each alone without the other’s power,
