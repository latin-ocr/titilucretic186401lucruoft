inde ad nos elisa bis advolat, aut etiam quod 315
340 circum agitur, cum venit, imago propterea quod
flexa figura docet speculi convertier ad nos,
indugredi porro pariter simulacra pedem-{ue
ponere nobiscum credas gestumque imitari
propterea quia, de speculi qua parte recedaS‚ 320
345 continuo nequeunt illinc simulacra reverti;
omnia quandoquidem cogit natura referri
ac resilire ab rebus *ad* aequos reddita flexus,
299 Splendida porro oculi fugitant vitantque tueri.

whatever part of a mii-ror you draw back, from that part forthwith no
idols can be reflected 3 since nature constrains all things, when they are
carried back and recoil from things to be given back in postures like νίρς)
those of the objects they represent. -, ’ „

¹ Bright things again the eyes eschew and shun to look upon: the sun
even blinds them, if you persist in turning them towards it, because its
power is great and idols are borne through the clear air with great down-
ward force from on high, and strike the eyes and disorder their faQe-rgings.
Moreover any vivid brightness often burns the eyes, because it contains
many seeds of fire which make a way in and beget pain in the eyes,
Again whatever the jaundiced look at, becomes a greenish-yellow, be-
cause many seeds of greenish-yellow stream from their body and meet
the idols of things, and many too are mixed up in their eyes, and these
by their infection tinge all things with sallow hues. Again we see out
