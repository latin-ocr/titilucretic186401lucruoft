cogit uti fiat spisso cava corpore circum,
post ubi conminuit vis eius et impetus acer,
tum pelterricrepo sonitu dat scissa fragorem.
nec mirum, cum plena animae vensicula parva 130
saepe ita dat magnum sonitum displosa repente.
Est etiam ratio, cum venti nubila perfiant,
ut sonitus faciant. etenim ramosa videmus

nubila saepe modis multis atque aspera ferri3

scilicet ut, crebram silvam cum flamina cauri 135
perflant, dant sonitum frondes ramique fragorem.

fit quoque ut interdum validi vis incita venti

perscindat nubem perfringens impete recto

nam quid possit ibi flatus manifesta docet 168,

arbusta evolvens radicibus haurit ab imis,

sunt etiam fluctus per nubila, qui quasi murmur

fluminibus magnoque mari, cum frangitur aestus.

ut calidis candens ferrum e fornacibus olim

it, then the cloud thus rent gives forth a crash with a hideous hurtling
noise. And no wonder, since a small bladder filled with air often emits
a great sound if suddenly burst.

It can also be explained how the winds‚ when they blow through the
clouds, make noises: we see branching and rough clouds often borne
along 111 many ways3 thus, you are to know, when the blasts of the
northwest blow through a dense forest, the leaves give forth a rustling
and the boughs a crashing. Sometimes too the force of the strong wind
when aroused rends the cloud, breaking through it by an assault right
in front: what a blast of wind can do there, is shewn by facts plain to
sense, when here 011 earth where it is gentler it yet twists out tall trees
and tears . them up from their deepest roots. There are also waves
among the clouds and they give 3 kind of roar as they break heavily3
just as in deep rivers and on the great sea when the surf breaks. Some-
times too when the burning force of thunder has fallen out of one cloud
into another, if haply the latter contains much moisture when it has
taken the fire into it, it drowns it at once with a loud noise 3 just so iron
glowing hot from the fiery furnaces sometimes 1118868, when we· have
