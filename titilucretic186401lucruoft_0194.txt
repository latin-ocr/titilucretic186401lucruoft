esse minora igitur quaedam maioraque debent,

esse triquetra aliis, aliis quadrata necessest,

multa rutunda, modis multis multangula quaedam.
namque figurarum ratio ut motusque reposcunt, 655
proinde foraminibus debent differre figurae,

et variare viae proinde ac textura coercet.

hoc ubi quod suave est aliis aliis fit amarum,

illi, cui suave est, levissima corpora debent
contractabiliter caulas intrare palati, 660
at contra quibus est eadem res intus acerba,

aspera nimirum penetrant hamataque fauces,

nunc facile est ex his rebus cognoscere quaeque.

quippe ubi cui febris bili superante coorta est

aut alia ratione aliquast vis excita morbi, 665
perturbatur ibi iam totum corpus et omnes
commutantur ibi positurae principiorum ;

fit prius ad sensum ut quae corpora conveniebant

nunc non conveniant, et cetera sint magis apta,

quae penetrata queunt sensum progignere acerbum; 670
utraque enim sunt in mellis commixta sapore3

id quod iam supera tibi saepe ostendimus ante.

therefore must be smaller, some larger3 some things must have three-
cornered, others square seeds 3 many seeds must be round, some many-
angled after many fashions. For as the relation between the shapes of
seeds and their motions require, the openings also must differ accord-
ingly in their shapes 3 and the passages must vary, as varies the texture
formed by the seeds which bound them. For this reason when that
which is sweet to some becomes bitter to others, for that creature to
whom it is sweet the smoothest bodies must enter the cavities of the
palate with power to feel them all over 3 but on the other hand in the
case of those to whom the same thing is bitter within, rough and
barbed seeds sure enough pass down the throat. It is easy now from
these principles to understand all particular cases: thus when a fever
has attacked any one from too great a flow of bile, or a violent disease
has been exeited in any other way, thereupon the whole body is dis-
ordered and all the arrangements of particles then and there changed ;
the consequence of which is that the bodies which before were suited to
excite sensation, suit no more 3 and those fit it better, which are able to
make their way in and beget a bitter sense. Both kinds for instance

are mixed up in the flavour of honey: a point we have often proved ·

before.
