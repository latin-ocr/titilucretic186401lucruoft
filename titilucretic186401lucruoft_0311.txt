praeterea cum rarescunt quoque nubila ventis

aut dissolvuntur, solis super icta calore,

mittunt umorem pluvium stillantque‚ quasi igni 515

carry them over the great sea. In like manner moisture is taken up out
of all rivers into the clouds 5 and when the seeds of waters many in
number in many ways have fully met 111 1116111, augmented from all
sides, then the close-packed clouds endeavour to discharge their moisture
from two causes: the force of the wind drives them together, and like-
wise the very abundance of the rain-clouds, when a greater mass 111311·
1181131 1138 gathered, pushes down, presses from above and forces the
rain to stream out. Again when the clouds are also rarefied by the
winds, or are dispersed, being smitten at the 831116 111116 by the heat of
the sun, they discharge a rainy moisture and trickle down, just as wax
over a hot fire melts away and turns fast into liquid. But a violent rain f
follows, when the clouds are violently pressed upon by both causes, by { (ἶ
their own accumulated weight and by the impetuous assa-ult of the wind. 1
And rains are wont to hold out and to last long, when many seeds of

⁸ waters are stirred to action, and clouds upon clouds and rack upon rack
welling forth from all quarters round about are borne along, and when
the reeking earth steams moisture back again from its whole sui-face.
When in such a 0386 1116 81111 has shone with his rays amid the murky

tempest right opposite the dripping rain-clouds, then the colour of the
rainbow shews itself among the black cloudS.
