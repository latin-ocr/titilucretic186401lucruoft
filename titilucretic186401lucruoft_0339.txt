aut in aquas cadit aut fruges persidit in ipsas
aut alios hominum pastus pecudumque 011131113,
aut etiam suspensa manet vis aere in ipso
et, 011111 spirantes mixtas hinc ducimus 311133,

consimili ratione venit bubus quoque saepe
pestilitas et iam pigris balantibus aegror.
nec refert utrum nos in loca deveniamus
nobis adversa et caeli mutemus amictum,
an caelum nobis ultro natura alienum 1135

sheep. And it makes no difference whether we travel to places unfa-
vourable to us and change the atmosphere which wraps us round, or
whether nature without our choice brings to 113 311 atmosphere unsuited
to us or something to the use of which we have not been accustomed‚
and which is able to attack us on its first arrival.

Such a form of disease and a death-fraught miasm erst within the
borders of Cecrops defiled the whole land with dead, and dispeopled the
streets, drained the town of burghers. Rising first and starting from
the inmost 00111013 of Egypt, after traversing much air and many fioat-
ing fields, the plague brooded at last over the whole people of Pandion 3
and then they were handed over in troops to disease and death. First of
all they would have the head seized with burning 110313 and both eyes
blood-shot with a glare diffused over: the livid throat within would
exude blood and the passage of the voice be clogged and choked with
