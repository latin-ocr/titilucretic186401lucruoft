At varios linguae sonitus natura subegit
mittere et utilitas expressit nomina rerum,
non alia longe ratione atque ipsa videtur 1030
protrahere ad gestum pueros infantia linguae,
cum facit ut digito quae sint praesentia monstrent.
sentit enim vim quisque suam quoad possit abuti.
cornua nata prius vitulo quam frontibus extent,
illis iratus petit atque infestus inurget. 1035
at catuli pantherarum scymniqueoeffinum
unguibus ac pedibus iam tum morsuque repugnant,
vix etiam cum sunt dentes unguesque creati.
alituum porro genus alis omne videmus
fidere et a pinnis tremulum petere auxiliatum. 1040
proinde putare aliquem tum nomina distribuisse
rebus et inde homines didicisse vocabula prima,

vocibus et varios sonitus emittere linguae,
tempore eodem alii facere id non quisse putentur? 1045

But nature impelled them to utter the various sounds of the tongue
and use struck out the names of things, much in the same way as the
inability to speak is seen in its turn to drive children to the use of ges-
tures, when it forces them to point with the finger at the things which
are before them. For every one feels how far he can make use of his
peculiar powers. Ere the horns of a calf are formed and prOJect from
his forehead, he butts with it when angry and pushes out in his rage.
Then whelps of panthers and cubs of lions fight with claws and feet and
teeth at a time when teeth and claws are hardly yet formed. Again we
see every kind of fowl trust to wings and seek from pinions a flutter-
ing succour. Therefore to suppose that some one man at that time
apportioned names to things and that men from him learnt their first
words, is sheer folly. For why should this particular man be able to
denote all things by words and to utter the various sounds of the tongue,
and yet at the same time others be supposed not to have been able to do
so'l Again if others as well as he had not made use of words among
themselves, whence was implanted in this man the previous conception
of its use and whence was given to him the original faculty, to know
and perceive in mind what he wanted to do 'l Again one man could not
