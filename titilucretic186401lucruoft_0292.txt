multa tamen restant et sunt ornanda politis

versibus 3 est ratio caeli speciesque tenenda,

sunt tempestates et fulmina clara canenda,

quid faciant et qua de 031133 cumque ferantur3 85

ne trepides caeli divisis partibus 31110113,

1111ᾶο volans ignis pervenerit aut in utram se

verterit 111110 partim, quo pacto per loca saepta

insinuarit, et hinc dominatus ut extulerit se.

tu mihi supremae praescribta ad candida 031013 92

Calliope, requies hominum divomque voluptaS‚

into quarters and be startled and distracted on seeing from which of
them the volant fire has come or to which of the two halves it has
betaken itself, in what way it has gained an entrance within walled

from these. Do thou, deft muse Calliope, solace of men and joy of gods,
point out the course before me as Ι 1300 to the white boundary-line of
the final goal, that under thy guidance I may win the erown with signal
ap lause.

pIn the first place the azure heights of heaven are shaken with
thunder, because the ethereal clouds clash together as they fly aloft
when the winds combat from opposite quarters. For no sound ever
comes from a cloudless part of heaven, but wheresoever the clouds are
gathered in a denser mass, from that part with greater frequency comes
a clap with a loud growl. Again clouds cannot be either of so dense a
body as stones and timbers, nor again so fine as mists and flying bodies
of smoke 3 for then they must either fall borne down by their dead
