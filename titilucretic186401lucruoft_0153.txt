corporis atque animae consistimus uniter apti.
nec, si materiem nostram collegerit aetas
post obitum rursumque redegerit ut sita nunc est
atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vitae,
pertineat quicquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum, 850
interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostri.
et nunc nil ad nos de nobis attinet, ante
qui fuimUS, neque iam de illis nos adficit angor.
nam cum respicias inmensi temporis omne
praeteritum spatium, tum motus materiai 855
multimodis quam sint, facile hoc adcredere possiS,
semina saepe in eodem, ut nunc sunt, ordine posta
865 haec eadem, quibus 0 1111110 1108 811111118, ante fuisse.
858 nec memori tamen id quimus repraehendere mente3
inter enim iectast vitai pausa vageque 860
deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omneS.
debet enim, misere si forte aegreque futurumst,
ipse quoque esse in eo tum tempore, cui male possit
accidere. id quoniam mors eximit, esseque probet
864 illum cui possint incommoda conciliari, 865
scire licet nobis nil esse in morte timendum
nec miserum fieri qui non est posse neque hilum

marriage between body and soul are formed each into one single being.
And if time should gather up our matter after our death and bring it
once more into the condition in which it now is, and the light of life be
given to us again, this result even would concern us not at all, when the
chain of our sels-consciousness has once been snapped asunder. So now
we give ourself no concern about any sels which we have been before,
nor do we feel any distress on the score of that self. For when you look
back 011 the whole past course of immeasurable time and think how
manifold are the shapes which the motions of matter take, you may
easily credit this too, that these very same seeds of which we now are
formed, have often before been placed in the same order in which they
now are3 and yet we cannot recover this in memory: a break in our
existence has been interposed, and all the motions have wandered to and
fro far astray from the sensations they produced. For he whom evil is
to befal, must in his own person exist at the very time it comes, if the
misery and suffering are haply to have any place at all 3 but since death
precludes this, and forbids him to be, upon whom the ills can be brought,
you may be sure that we have nothing to sear after death, and that 110
who exists not, cannot become miser-able, and that it matters not a whit
