V 263

N unc quae causa deum per 'magnas numina gentis
pervulgarit et ararum compleverit urbis
suscipiendaque curarit sollemnia} sacra,
quae nunc in magnis florent sabra rebu' locisque,
unde etiam nunc est mortalibus insitus* horror · 1165
qui delubra deum nova toto suscitat orbi
terrarum et festis cogit celebrare diebus,
non ita difficilest rationem reddere verbis
quippe etenim iam tum divom mortalia saecla
egregias animo facies vigilante videbant 1170
et magis in somnis mirando corporis auctu,
his igitur sensum tribuebant propterea quod
membra movere videbantur vocesque superbas
mittere pro facie praeclara· et viribus amplis,
aeternamque dabant vitam, quia semper eorum 1175
subpeditabatur facies et forma manebat,
et tamen omnino quod tantis viribus auctos
non temere ulla vi convinci posse putabant.
fortunisque ideo longe praestare putabant,
quod mortis timor haut quemquam vexaret eorum, 1180

>et simul in somnis quia multa et mira videbant

Ἢ..

efficere et nullum capere ipsos inde laborem.
praeterea caeli rationes ordine certo

And now what cause has spread over great nations the worship of
the divinities of the gods and. filled towns with altars and led to the
performance of stated sacred rites‚ rites now in fashion on solemn (51ρὲ-
sions and in solemn places, from which even now is implanted in mortals
a shuddering awe which raises new temples of the gods over the whole
earth and prompts men to crowd them on festive days, all this it is not
so difficult to explain in words. Even then in sooth the races of mortal
men would see in waking mind glorious forms, would see them in sleep
of yet more marvellous size of body. To these then they would attribute
sense, because they seemed to move their limbs and to utter lofty words
suitable to their glorious aspect and surpassing powers. And they would
give them life everlasting, because their face would ever appear before
them and their form abide 3 yes and yet without all this, because they
would not believe that beings possessed of such powers could lightly be
overcome by any force. And they would believe them to be preeminent
in bliss, because none of them was ever troubled with the sear of death,
and because at the same time they would see them perform many
miracles, yet feel on their part no fatigue from the effort. Again they

would see the system of heaven and the different seasons of the years
