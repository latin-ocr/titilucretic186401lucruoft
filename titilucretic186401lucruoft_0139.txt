aut aliam quamvis naturam flectere quaerit.

at neque transferri sibi partis nec tribui vult

inmortale quod est quicquam neque defluere hilum.

nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,

continuo hoc mors est illius quod fuit ante. 520

ergo animus sive aegrescit, mortalia signa

mittit, uti docui, seu flectitur a medicina.

usque adeo falsae rationi vera videtur

res occurrere et effugium praecludere eunti

ancipitique refutatu convincere falsum. 525
Denique saepe hominem paulatim cernimus ire

et membratim vitalem deperdere sensum;

in pedibus primum digitos livescere et unguis,

inde pedes et crura mori, post inde per artus

ire alios tractim gelidi vestigia leti. 530
scinditur itque animae hoc quoniam natura nec uno
tempore sincera existit, mortalis habendast. ,τ «51³5-

parts transposed nor any addition to be made nor one tittle to ebb away 3
for whenever a thing changes and quits its proper limits, this change
is at once the death of that which was before. Therefore the mind,
whether it is sick or whether it is altered by medicine, alike‚ as I have
shewn, gives forth mortal symptoms. So invariably is truth found to
make head against false reason and to cut off all retreat from the assailant
and by a two-edged refutation to put falsehood to rout.

Again we often see a man pass gradually away and limb by limb lose
vital sense3 first the toes of his feet and the nails turn livid, then the
feet and shanks die, then next the steps of chilly death creep with slow
pace over the other members. Since 111 this way the nature of the soul
is rent and passes away and comes not forth all at once in its entireness,
it must be reckoned mortal. But if haply you suppose that it can draw
itself in through the whole frame and mass its parts together and in this
way withdraw sense from all the limbs, yet then that spot into which so
great a store of soul is gathered‚ ought to shew itself in possession of a
greater amount of sense. But as this is nowhere found, sure enough as
we said before, it is torn in pieces and scattered abroad‚ and therefore
