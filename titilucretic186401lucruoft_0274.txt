et capitis summi praeclarum insigne cruentum

sub pedibus vulgi magnum lugebat honorem3

nam cupide conculcatur nimis ante metutum. 1 140
res itaque ad summam faecem turbasque redibat,
imperium sibi cum ac summatum quisque petebat.

inde magistratum partim docuere creare

iuraque constituere, ut vellent legibus uti.

nam genus humanum, defessum vi colere aevom, 1145
ex inimicitiis languebat3 quo magis ipsum

sponte sua cecidit sub leges artaque iura.

acrius ex ira quod enim se quisque parabat

ulcisci quam nunc concessumst legibus aequiS‚

hanc ob rem est homines pertaesum vi colere aevom. 1150
inde metus maculat poenarum praemia vitae.

circumretit enim vis atque iniuria quemque

atque, unde exortast, ad eum plerumque revertit,

nec facilest placidam ac pacatam degere vitam

qui violat factis communia foedera pacis, 1 15 5
etsi fallit enim divom genus humanumque,

perpetuo tamen id fore clam diffidere debet;

quippe ubi se multi per somnia saepe loquentes

aut morbo delirantes protra-{e ferantur

et celata mala in medium et peccata dedisse] 1160

the sovereign head bloodstained beneath the feet of the rabble mourned
for its high prerogative ,- for that is greedily trampled on which before
was too much dreaded. Power therefore would fall to the lowest dregs
and to unruly mobs, each man secking for himself empire and sovereignty.
Then a portion of them taught men to elect legal officers‚ and drew up
codes, to induce men to obey the laws. For mankind, tired out with a
life of brute force, lay exhausted from its feuds 3 and therefore the more
readily it submitted of its own freewill to laws and stringent codes. For
as each one moved by anger took measures to avenge himself with
more severity than is now permitted by equitable laws, for this reason
men grew sick of a life of brute force. Thence fear of punishment mars
the prizes of life 3 for violence and wrong enclose all who commit them in
their meshes and do mostly recoil on him from whom they began 3 and
it is not easy for him who transgresses the terms of the public peace to
pass a tranquil and a peaceful existence. For though he eludes God and
man, yet he cannot but feel a misgiving that his secret can be kept for
ever 3 seeing that many by speaking in their dreams or in the wanderings
of disease have often we are told betrayed themselves and have disclosed
their hidden deeds of evil and their sins.
