hic quoque confligunt hiemes aestatibus acres,
propterea freta sunt haec anni nominitanda,

ancipiti quoniam bello turbatur utrimque,

Hoc est igniferi naturam fulminis ipsam

unde volans ignis pervenerit aut in utram se

mers. Therefore thaee seasons are to be called the cross-seas of the
yea'r ; and it is not wonderful, that in that season thunderbolts are most

then engage in the troublous medley of dubious war, the one armed with
flames, the other with winds and water commingled.

This is the way to see into the true nature of the thunderbolt and
to understand by what force it produces each effect, and not the turning
over the scrolls of Tyrrhene charms and vainly searching for tokens of
the hidden will of the gods, in order to know from what quarter the
volant fire has come or to which of the two halves it has betaken itself‚
in what way it has gained an entrance within walled places, and how
after lording it with tyrant sway it has extricated itself from these 3 also
what· harm the thunderstroke from heaven can do. But if Jupiter and
other gods *shake with an appalling crash the glittering quarters of hea-
ven, and hurl their fire whither each is so minded, why strike they not
those whoever they be who have recked not of committing some abomi-
nable sin and make them give forth the flames of lightning from breast
pierced through and through, a sharp lesson to men'l and why rather is
