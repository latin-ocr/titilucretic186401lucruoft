quidquid id est, quacumque e causa flammeus ardor
horribili sonitu silvas exederat altis
ab radicibus et terram percoxerat igni,
manabat venis ferventibus in loca terrae 125 5
concava conveniens argenti rivus et auri,
aeris item et plumbi. quae cum concreta videbant
posterius claro in terra splendere colore,

tollebant nitido capti levique lepore

et simili formata videbant esse figura 1260
atque lacunarum fuerant vestigia cuique.

tum penetrabat eos posse haec liquefacta calore

from their very roots and had thoroughly baked the earth with fire, there
would run from the boiling veins and collect into the hollows of the
ground a stream of silver and gold, as well as of copper and lead. And
when they saw these afterwards cool into lumps and glitter on the earth
with a brilliant giem, they would list them up attracted by the might
and polished lustre, and they would see them to be moulded in a shape
the same as the outline of the cavities in which each lay. Then it would
strike them that these might be melted by heat and cast in any form or
shape soever, and might by hammering out be brought to tapering points
of any degree of sharpness and ‚fineness, so as to furnish them with tools
and enable them to cut the forests and hew timber and plane smooth
the planks, and also to drill and pieroe and bore. And they would set
about these works just as much with silver and gold at first as with the
overpowering strength of stout copper, but 111 vain, since their force would
fail and give way and not be able like copper to stand the severe strain.
At that time copper was in higher esteem and gold would lie neglected
on account of its uselessness, with its dull blunted edge: now copper
