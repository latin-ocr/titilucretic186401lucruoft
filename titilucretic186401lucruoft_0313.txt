heaven, lean over and bulge out yielding in the same directim, and the
timbers wrenched from their supports hang over ready to give way. And
yet men shrink from believing that a time of destruction and ruin
awaits the nature of the great world, though they see 80 great a mass of
earth hang ready to fall! And if the winds did not abate their blowing‚
no force could rein things in or hold them up on their road to destruc-
