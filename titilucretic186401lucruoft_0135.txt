quatenus est unum inter se coniunctaque res est.
principio quoniam tenuem constare minutis 42 5
corporibus docui multoque minoribus esse
principiis factam quam liquidus umor aquai
aut nebula aut fumusz—nam longe mobilitate
praestat et a tenui causa magis icta movetur3
quippe ubi imaginibus fumi⁴ nebulaeque movetur: 430
quod genus in somnis sopiti ubi cernimus alte
exhalare vaporem altaria ferreque fumum3
nam procul hinc dubio nobis simulacra genuntur2—
nunc igitur quoniam quassatis undique vasis
diffluere umorem et laticem discedere cernis 435
et nebula ac fumus quoniam discedit in auraS,
crede animam quoque diffundi multoque perire

cum semel ex hominis membris ablata recessit.
quippe etenim corpus, quod vas quasi constitit eiUS, 440-
quam cohibere nequit conquassatum ex aliqua re

since I have shewn the soul to be fine and to be formed of· minute bodies
and made up of much smaller first-beginnings than is the liquid of
water or mist or smoke z—for it far surpasses these in nimbleness and
moves if struck by a far slenderer cause 3 inasmuch as it moves by images
of smoke and mist 3 as when for instance sunk in sleep we 866 altars
steam forth their heat and send up their smoke on high3 for beyond
a doubt images are begotten for us from these things z—well then since
you see on the vessels being shattered the water fiow away on all
sideS, and since mist and smoke pass away into air, believe that the
soul too is shed abroad and perishes much more quickly and dissolves
sooner into its first bodies, when once it has been taken out of the limbs
of a man and has withdrawn. For how can you believe that this soul
which the body that serves for its vessel‚ cannot hold, if shattered from
any cause and rarefied by the withdrawal of blood from the veins‚ how
can you believe I say that this soul can be held by any air? how can
that air which is rarer than our body hold it in 2

Again we perceive that the mind is begotten along with the body
and grows up together with it and becomes old along with it. For even
