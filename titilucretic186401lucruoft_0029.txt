corporis officiumst quoniam premere omnia deorsum,
contra autem natura manet sine pondere inanis,
ergo quod magnumst aeque leviusque videtur,
nimirum plus esse sibi declarat inanis; 365
at contra gravius plus in se corporis esse
dedicat et multo vacui minus intus habere.
est igitur nimirum id quod ratione sagaci
quaerimus, admixtum rebus, quod inane vocamus,
Illud in his rebus ne te deducere vero 370
possit, quod quidam fingunt, praecurrere cogor.
cedere squamigeris latices nitentibus aiunt
et liquidas aperire viaS, quia post loca pisces
linquant, quo possint cedentes confluere undae;
sic alias quoque res inter se posse moveri 375
et mutare locum, quamvis sint omnia plena.
scilicet id falsa totum ratione receptumst.
nam quo squamigeri poterunt procedere tandem,
ni spatium dederint latices? concedere porro
quo poterunt undae, cum pisces ire nequibunt? 380
aut igitur motu privandumst corpora quaeque
aut esse admixtum dicundumst rebus inane
unde initum primum capiat res quaeque movendi.
postremo duo de concursu corpora lata

is to weigh all things downwards, while on the contrary the nature of
void is ever without weight. Therefore when a thing is just as large,
yet is found to be lighter, it proves sure enough that it has more of void
in it 3 while on the other hand that which is heavier shews that there
is in it more of body and that it contains within it much less of void.
Therefore that which we are secking with keen-sighted reason 01118118
sure enough, mixed up in things 3 and we call it void.

And herein I am obliged to forestall this point which some raise, lest
it draw you away from the truth. The waters they say make way for
the scaly creatures as they press on, and open liquid paths, because the
fish leave room behind them, into which the yielding waters may
stream ,· thus other things too may move and change place among them-
selves, although the whole sum be full. This you are to know has been
taken up wholly on false grounds. For on what side I ask can the
scaly creatures move forwards‚ unless the waters have first made room‘l
again on what side can the waters give place, so long as the fish are un-
able to go on? Therefore you must either strip all bodies of motion or
admit that in things void is mixed up from which every thing gets its
first start in moving. Lastly if two broad bodies after contact quickly
