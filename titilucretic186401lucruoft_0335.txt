VI 32 3

sollicito motu semper iactatur eoque
verberat anellum dubio procul et ciet intus
scilicet: ille eodem fertur quo praecipitavit 1040
iarn semel et partem in vacuam conamina sumpsit.
Fit quoque ut a lapide 1100 ferri natura recedat
interdum, sugere atque sequi consueta vicissim.
exultare etiam Samothracia ferrea vidi
et ramenta simul ferri furere intus ahenis 1045
in scaphiis, lapis hic Magnes 011111 subditus esset:
usque adeo fugere ab saxo gestire videtur.
aere interposito discordia tanta creatur
propterea quia nimirum prius aestus ubi aeris

praecepit ferrique vias possedit apertaS, 1050
posterior lapidis venit aestus et omnia plena
invenit in ferro neque habet qua tranet ut ante.

cogitur offensare igitur pulsareque fluctu

ferrea texta suo; quo pacto respuit ab se

atque per aes agitat, sine eo quod saepe resorbet. 1055
illud in his rebus mirari mitte, quod aestus

11011 valet e lapide hoc alias impellere item res,

pondere enim fretae partim stantz. quod genus aurum3
et partim raro quia sunt cum corpore, ut aestus

iron, is ever stirred in restless motion and therefore beats the ring with-
out a doubt and stirs it within, you know: the ring is carried in the
direction in which it has once plunged forward‚ and into the void part

towards which it has made its start.
Sometimes too it happens that the nature of ironis repelled from this

stone, being in the habit of fiying from and following it in turns. I have
seen Samothracian iron rings even jump up, and at the same time filings
of iron rave within brass basins, when this Magnet stone had been placed
under: such a strong desire the iron seems to have to fly from the stone.
So great a disturbance is raised by the interposition of the brass, because
sure enough when the current of the brass has first seized on and taken
possession of the open passages of the iron, the current of the stone comes
after and finds all things'full in the iron and has no opening to swim
through as before. It is forced therefore to dash against and beat with
its wave the iron texture 3 by which means it repels from it and sets in
motion through the brass that which without the brass it often draws to
itself. And forbear herein to wonder that the current from this stone
is not able to set in motion other things as well as iron: some of these
stand still by the power of their own weight; for instance gold 3 and

others, because they are of so rare a body that the current fiies through.
