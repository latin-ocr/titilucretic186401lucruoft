quod quasi tertia sit numero natura reperta.
nam quodcumque erit, esse aliquid debebit id ipsumÍ¾
43 5 cui si tactus erit quamvis levis exiguusque,
434 augmine vel grandi vel parvo denique, 'dum sit, 435
corporis augebit numerum summamque sequetur.
sin intactile erit, nulla de parte quod ullam
rem prohibere queat per se transire meantem,
scilicet hoc id erit, vacuum quod inane vocamus,
praeterea per se quodcumque erit, aut faciet quid 440
aut aliis fungi debebit agentibus ipsum
aut erit ut possint in eo res esse gerique.
at facere et fungi sine corpore nulla potest res
nec praebere locum porro nisi inane vacansque.
ergo praeter inane et corpora tertia per se 445
nulla potest rerum in numero natura relinqui,
nec quae sub sensus cadat ullo tempore nostros
nec ratione animi quam quisquam possit apisci.

Nam quaecumque cluent, aut his coniuncta duabus
rebus ea invenies aut horum eventa videbis 450
coniunctum est id quod nusquam sine permiciali
discidio potis est seiungi seque gregari,
pondus uti saxist, calor ignis, liquor aquai.

from void, which would so to say count as the discovery of a third
nature. For whatever shall exist, this of itself must be something or
other. Now if it shall admit of touch in however slight and small a
measure, it will, be it with a large or be it with a little addition, pro-
videdit do exist, increase the amount of body and join the sum. But
if it shall be intangible and unable to hinder any thing from passing
through it 011 any side, this you are to know will be that which we call
empty void. Again whatever shall exist by itseff, will either do some-
thing or will itself suffer by the action of other things, or else ingit
things will be able to exist and go 011. But no thing can do and suffer
without body nor aught furnish room except void and vacancy. There-
fore beside void and bodies no third nature taken by itself can be left in
the number of things, either such as to fall at any time under the ken of
our senses or such as any one can grasp by the reason of his mind.

For whatever things are named, you will either find to be properties
linked to these two things or you will see to be accidente of these
things. That is a property which can in no case be disjoined and
separated without destruction accompanying the severance, such as
the weight of a stone, the heat of fire, the fluidity of water. Slavery
