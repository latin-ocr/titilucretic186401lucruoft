dissoluitque, cadant ingratis illa necessest
ἶ semina quae faciunt fulgorem. tum sine taetro
] terrore et sonitu fulgit nulloque tumultu.

Quod superest, quali natura praedita constent
fulmina, declarant ictus et inusta vaporis 220
signa notaeque gravis halantis sulpuris auras.
ignis enim sunt haec non venti signa neque imbris
praeterea saepe accendunt quoque tecta domorum
et celeri flamma dominantur in aedibus ipsis,
hunc tibi subtilem cum primis ignibus ignem 225
constituit natura minutis mobilibusque
corporibUS, cui nil omnino obsistere possit.
transit enim validum fulmen- per saepta domorum,
clamor ut ac voceS, transit per saxa, per aera,
et liquidum puncto facit aes in tempore et aurum, 230
curat item vasis integris vina repente
diffugiant, quia nimirum facile omnia circum
conlaxat rareque facit lateramina vasis
adveniens calor eius et insinuatus in ipsum
mobiliter soluens differt primordia vini. 235
quod solis vapor aetatem non posse videtur
efficere usque adeo pellens fervore corusco:

ravels and breaks them up as they move, those seeds which produce the
lightning must fal] perforce3 and then it lightens without a hideous
startling noise and without any uproar.

Well, to proceed, what kind of nature thunderbolts possess, is shewn
by their strokes and the traces of their heat which have burnt themselves
into things and the marks which exhale the noxious vapours of sulphur:
all these are signs of fire, not of wind 01· rain. Again they often set on
fire even the roofs of houses and with swift flame rule resistless within
the house. This fire subtle above all fires nature, you are to know, forms
of minute and lightly moving bodies, and it is such as nothing whatever
can withstand. The mighty thunderbolt passes through the walls of
houses, like a shout and voices, passes through stones, through brass,
and in a moment of time melts brass and gold 3 and causes wine too in
an instant to disappear‚ while the vessels are untouched, because sure
enough its heat on reaching it readily loosens and rarefies all the earthen
material of the vessel on every side and forcing a way within lightly
separates‘and disperses the first-beginnings of the wine. This the sun's heat
would be unable to accomplish in an age, though beating on it incessantly
