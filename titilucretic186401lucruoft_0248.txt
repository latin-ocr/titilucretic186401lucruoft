Again the disk of the 81111 cannot be much larger nor its body of
heat much smaller, than they appear to be to our 8611868. For from
whatever distances fires can reach us with their light and breathe on our
limbs burning heat, those distances take away nothing by such spaces
between from the body of the flames, the fire is not in the least narrowed
in appearance. Therefore since the heat of the sun and the light which
it sheds reach our senses and stroke the proper places, the form too and
size of the sun must be seen from this earth in their real dimensions, so
that you may not add anything whatever more or less. And whether
the moon 68 11 18 borne on illuminates places with 6 bort-owed light, or
6111118 118 own light from its own body, whatever that is, the form with
which it is thus borne on 18 1101 at 611 larger than the one which it
