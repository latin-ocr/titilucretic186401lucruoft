transire et magnos manibus divellere montis
multaque vivendo vitalia vincere saecla,
si non, materies quia rebus reddita certast '⁴
gignundis e qua constat quid possit oriri?
nil igitur fieri de nilo posse fatendumst, 205
semine quando opus est rebus quo quaeque creatae
aeris in teneras possint proferrier auras,
postremo quoniam incultis praestare videmus
culta loca et manibus melioris reddere fetus,
esse videlicet in terris primordia rerum 210
quae nos fecundas vertentes vomere glebas
terraique solum subigentes cimus ad ortus,
quod si nulla forent, nostro sine quaeque labore
sponte sua multo fieri meliora videres
Huc accedit uti quicque in sua corpora rursum 215
dissoluat natura neque ad nilum interemat res,
nam siquid mortale e cunctis partibus esset,
ex oculis res quaeque repente erepta periret.
nulla vi foret usus enim quae partibus eius
discidium parere et nexus exsolvere posset. 220
quod nunc, aeterno quia constant semine quaeque,
donec vis obiit quae res diverberet ictu
aut intus penetret per inania dissoluatque‚

and rend great mountains with their hands and outlive many genera-
tions of living men, if not because an unchanging matter has been
assigned for begetting things and what can arise out of this matter is
fixed? We must admit therefore that nothing can come from nothing,
since things require seed before they can severally be born and be
brought out into the buxom fields of air. Lastly since we see that
tilled grounds surpass untilled and yield a better produce by the labour
of hands, we may infer that there are in the earth first-beginnings of
things which we by turning up the fruitful clods with the share and
labouring the soil of the earth stimulate to rise. But if there were
no such, you would see all things without any labour of ours sponta-
neously come forth in much greater perfectiori.

Moreover nature dissolves every thing back into its first bodies and
does not annihilate things, For if aught were mortal in all its parts
alike, the thing in a moment would be snatched away to destruction
from before our eyes 3 since no force would be needed to produce dis-
ruption among its parts and undo their fastenings. Whereas in fact,
as all things consist of an imperishable seed, nature suffers the destruc-
tion of nothing to be seen, until a force has encountered it sufficient
