which they severally go on.

Bodies again are partly first-beginnings of things, partly those which
are formed of a union of first-beginningS. But those which are first-
beginnings of things no force can quench: they are sure to have the
better by their solid body. Although it seems difficult to believe that
aught can be found among things with a solid body. For the lightning
of heaven passes through the walls of houses, as well as noise and voices ;
iron grows red-hot in the fire and rocks burning with fierce heat burst
asunder 3 the hardness of gold is broken up and dissolved by heat 3 the
ice of brass melts vanquished by the flame 3 warmth and piercing cold
ooze through silver, since we have felt both as we held cups with the
hand in due fashion and the water was poured down into them. So
universally there is found to be nothing solid in things. But yet
because true reason and the nature of things consti-ains, attend until we
