temptari procul a patria quicumque domoque

adveniunt ideo quia longe discrepitant res'.2 Ι 105
nam quid Brittanni caelum differre putamuS‚

et quod 111 Aegypto est qua mundi claudicat axiS,
quidve quod in Ponto est differre, et Gadibus atque
usque ad nigra virum percocto saecla colore-2

quae cum quattuor inter se diversa videmus 1 110
quattuor a ventis et caeli partibus esse,

tum color et facies hominum distare videntur

largiter et morbi generatim saecla tenere.

est elephas morbus qui propter flumina Nili

gignitur Aegypto in media neque praeterea usquam. 1115
Atthide temptantur gressus oculique in Achaeis

finibus, inde aliis alius locus est inimicus

partibus ac membris: varius concinnat id aer.

proinde ubi se caelum quod nobis forte alienum
commovet atque aer inimicus serpere coepit, 1120
ut nebula ac nubes paulatim repit et omne

qua graditur conturbat et immutare coactat;

fit quoque ut, in nostrum cum venit denique caelum,
corrumpat reddatque sui simile atque alienum.

haec igitur subito clades nova pestilitasque 1125

country and home are affected by the strangeness of climate and water,
because there are wide differences in such things? for what a difference
may we suppose between the climate of the Briton and that of Egypt
where the pole of heaven slants askew, and again between that in Pontus
and that of Gades and so on to the races of men black with sun-baked
complexion 2 Now as we see these four climates under the four opposite
winds and quarters of heaven all differing from each other, so also the
complexions and faces of the men are seen to differ widely and diseases
varying in kind are found to seize upon the different raceS. There is
the elephant disease which is generated beside the streams os Nile in the
midst of Egypt and nowhere else. In Attica the feet are attacked and
the eyes 111 Achaean lands. And so different places are hurtful to differ-
ent parts and members: the variations of air occasion that. Therefore
when an atmosphere which happens to put itself in motion unsuited to
us and a hurtful air begin to advance, they creep slowly on in the shape
of mist and cloud and disorder everything in their line of advance and
compel all to change ,· and when they have at length reached our atmo-
sphere, they corrupt it too and make it like to themselves and unsuited
to us. This new destroying power and pestilence therefore either fall
