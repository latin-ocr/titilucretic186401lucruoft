verum, ut opinor, itast: sunt quaedam corpora quorum
concursus motus ordo positura figurae 685
efficiunt igniS, mutatoque ordine mutant

naturam neque sunt igni simulata neque ulli

praeterea rei quae corpora mittere possit
sensibus et nostros adiectu tangere tactus,
Dicere porro ignem res omnis esse neque ullam 690
rem veram in numero rerum constare nisi ignem,
quod facit hic idem, perdelirum esse videtur.

nam contra 86118118 ab sensibus ipse repugnat
et labefactat eos unde omnia credita pendent,

unde hic cognitus est ipsi quem nominat ignem3 695

credit enim sensus ignem cognoscere vere,

quod mihi cum vanum tum delirum esse videtur;

quo referemus enim? quid nobis certius ipsis

sensibus esse potest, qui vera ac falsa notemus? 700

praeterea quare quisquam magis omnia tollat

et velit ardoris naturam linquere solam,

quam neget esse ignis quidvis tamen esse relinquat?

aequa videtur enim dementia dicere utrumque.
Quapropter qui materiem rerum esse putarunt 705

there are certain bodies whose clashings motions order position shapes
produce fires, and. which by a change of order change the nature of the
things and do not resemble fire nor anything else which has the power
of sending bodies to our senses and touching by its contact our sense of

Again to say that all things are fire and that no real thing except
fire exists in the number of things, as this same man (1068, appears to be
sheer dotage. For he himself takes his stand on the side of the senses to
fight against the senses and shakes their authority, on which rests all
our belief, ay from which this fire as he calls it is known to himself 3 for
he believes that the 8611868 6611 truly perceive fire, he does not believe
they can perceive all other things which 616 1101 6 whit less clear. Now
this appears to me to be as false as it is foolish3 for to what shall
we appeal‘l what surer test can we have than the senses, whereby to
note truth and. falsehood‘l Again why should any one rather abolish all
things and choose to leave the single nature of 11661, than deny that fires
exist, while he allows any thing else to be? it seems to be equa] madness
to affirm either this or that.

For these reasons they who have held that fire is the matter of
