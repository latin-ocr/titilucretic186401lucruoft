cum tamen inter se versus 36 verba necessest 825

Let us now also examine the homoeomeria of Anaxagoras as the
Greeks term it, which the poverty of our native speech does not allow
us to name in our own tongue ; though it is easy enough to set forth in
words the thing itself. First of all then, when he speaks of the homoeo-
