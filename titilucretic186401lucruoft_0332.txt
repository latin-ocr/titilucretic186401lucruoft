barbigeras oleaster eo iuvat usque capellas, 970
effluat ambrosiae quasi vere et nectari' linctus3

qua nil est homini quod amariu’ frondeat esca.

denique amaracinum fugitat sus et timet omne
ungentum3 nam saetigeris subus acre venenumst‚

quod nos interdum tamquam recreare videtur. 975
at contra nobis caenum taeterrima cum sit

spurcitieS, eadem subus haec iucunda videtur,

Hoc etiam superest, ipsa quam dicere de re

multa foramina cum variis sint reddita rebUS‚

so welcome to swine that they wallow in it all over with a craving not

There is still one point left which it seems proper to mention, before
I come to speak of the matter in hand. Since many pores are assigned
to various things, they must possess natures differing the one from the
other and must have each its own nature, its own direction: thus there
are in living creatur-es various senses, each of which takes into it in its own
peculiar way its own special object 3 for we see that sounds pass into one
thing, taste from different flavours into another thing, smells into another.
Again one thing is seen to stream through stones and¹ another thing to
pass through woodS, another through gold, and another still to go out
