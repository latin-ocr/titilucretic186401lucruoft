the very arrangements of heaven, I would venture to affirm, and led
by many other circumstances to maintain, that the nature of the world
has by no means been made for us by divine powert so great are the
defects with which it stands encumbered. All which, Memmius, we will
hereafter make clear 10 you: we will now go on 10 explain what remains
to be told of motions.

Now methinks is the place, herein to prove this point also that 110
bodily thing can by its o'wn power be borne upwards and travel up-
wards; that the bodies of flames may not in this matter lead you into
error. For they are begotten with an upward tendency, and 111 1110
same direction receive increase, and goodly crops and trees grow up-
wards, ,though their weights‚ so far as in them 15, 011 tend downwards.
And when fires leap to the roofs of houses and with swift flame lick up
rafters and beams, we are not to suppose that they do so spontaneously
without a force pushing them up. Even thus blood discharged from
cur body spirts out and springs up 011 high and scatters 8010 about.
