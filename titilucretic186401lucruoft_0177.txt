IV 165

N unc age, cur ultra speculum videatur imago
percipe 3 nam certe penitus semota videtur. 270
quod genus illa foris quae vere transpiciuntur‚
ianua cum per se transpectum praebet apertum,
multa facitque foris ex aedibus ut videantur.
is quoque enim duplici geminoque fit aere visus,
primus enim citra postes tum cernitur aer, 275
inde fores ipsae dextra laevaque secuntur,
post extraria lux oculos perterget et aer
alter et illa foris quae vere transpiciuntur.
sic ubi se primum speculi proiecit imago,
dum venit ad nostras acieS‚ protrudit agitque 280
aera qui inter se cumquest oculosque locatuS,
et facit ut prius hunc omnem sentire queamus
quam speculum. sed ubi speculum quoque sensimus ipsum,
continuo a nobis in idem quae fertur imago
pervenit et nostros oculos reiecta revisit 28 5
atque alium prae se propellens aera volvit
et facit ut prius hunc quam se videamus, eoque
distare ab speculo tantum semota videtur.
quare etiam atque etiam minime mirarier est par,
illic quor reddant speculorum ex aequore visum, 290
aeribus binis quoniam res confit utraque.

Now mark, and learn why the image is seen beyond the mirror 3 for
without doubt it is seen withdrawn far within. The case is just the
same as with things which are viewed in their reality beyond a door,
when it offers through it an unobstructed prospect and lets many things
outside be seen from a house. That vision too is effected by two
separate airs : first there is an air seen in such a case inside the door-
way 3 next come the leaves of the door right and left 3 next a light
outside brushes the eyes, then a second air, then those things outside
which are viewed in their reality. Thus when the image of the mirror
has first discharged itself, in coming to our sight it pushes forward and
impels all the air which lies between it and the eyes, and enables us to
see the whole of it before the mirror. But when we have perceived the
mirror as well, at once the image which is conveyed from us reaches the
mirror and then is reflected and comes back to our eyes, and drives on
and rolls in front of it a second air and lets us see this before itself, and
for this reason it looks so sar withdrawn from the mirror. Wherefore
again and again I repeat there is no cause at all to wonder why the
images give back the reflexion from the surface of mirrors in the spot
they do, since in both the given cases the result is produced by two airS.
