quin potius tali natura praedita quaedam
corpora constituas ignem si forte crearint,
posse eadem demptis paucis paucisque tributiS, 800
ordine mutato et motU, facere aeris auraS‚
sic alias aliis rebus mutarier omnis?
‘At manifesta palam res indicat' inquis ‘ in auras
aeris e terra res omnis crescere alique3
et nisi tempestas indulget tempore fausto 805
imbribus ut tabe nimborum arbusta vacillent,
solque sua pro parte fovet tribuitque calorem,
crescere non possint fruges arbusta animantis!
scilicet et nisi nos cibus aridus et tener umor
adiuvet, amisso iam corpore vita quoque omnis 810
omnibus e nervis atque ossibus exsoluatur 3
adiutamur enim dubio procul atque alimur nos
certis ab rebUS, certis aliae atque aliae res,
nimirum quia multa modis communia multis
multarum rerum in rebus primordia mixta 815
sunt, ideo variis variae res rebus aluntur.
atque eadem magni refert primordia saepe
cum quibus et quali positura contineantur
et quos inter se dent motus accipiantque3
namque eadem caelum mare terras flumina solem 820

there are certain bodies possessed of such a nature, that, if they have
haply produced fire, the same may, after a few have been taken away
and a few added on and the order and motion changed, produce air,
and that all other things may in the same way interchange with one
another?

‘ But plain matter of fact clearly proves ’ you say ‘that all things
grow up into the air and are fed out of the earth ; and unless the sea-son
at the propitious period send such abundant showers that the trees reel
beneath the soaking storms of rain, and unless the sun on its part foster
them and supply heat, corn trees living things could not grow.’ Quite
true, and unless solid food and soft water should recruit us, the body
would waste away and then the whole life would break up out of all the
sinews and bones ; for we beyond doubt are recruited and fed by cer-
tain things, this and that other thing by certain other things. Because
many first-beginnings common to many things in many ways are mixed
up in things, therefore sure enough different things are fed by different
things. And it often makes a great difference with what things and
in what position the same first-beginnings are held in union and what
>motions they mutually impart and receive 3 for the same ,make up
