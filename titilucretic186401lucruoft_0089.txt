ΙΙ 77

nec nox ulla diem neque noctem aurora secutast

quae non audierit mixtos vagitibus aegris

ploratus mortis comites et funeris atri. 580
Illud in his obsignatum quoque rebus habere

convenit et memori mandatum mente tenere,

nil esse, in promptu quorum natura videtur,

quod genere ex uno consistat principiorum,

nec quicquam quod non permixto semine constet. 585

et quodcumque magis vis multas possidet in se

atque potestateS, ita plurima principiorum

in sese genera ac varias docet esse figuras

principio tellus habet in se corpora prima

unde mare inmensum volventes frigora fontes 590

adsidue renovent, habet ignes unde oriantur.

nam multis succensa locis ardent sola terrae,

eximiis vero furit ignibus impetus Aetnae.

tum porro nitidas fruges arbustaque laeta

gentibus humanis habet unde extollere possit, 595

unde etiam fluvios frondes et pabula laeta

montivago generi possit praebere ferarum.

quare magna deum mater materque ferarum

et nostri genetrix haec dicta est corporis una.

of light 3 and no night ever followed day nor morning night that heard
not mingling with the sickly infant's ories wailings the attendants on
death and black funeral.

And herein it is proper you should keep under seal and guard, there
consigned‚ in faithful memory this truth, that there is nothing whose
nature is apparent to sense, which consists of one kind of first-begin-
nings3 nothing which is not formed by a mixing of seed. And when-
ever a thing possessos in itself in a greater degree many powers and
properties, in that measure it shews that there are in it the greatest
number of different kinds and varied shapes of first-beginnings. First
of all the earth has in her first bodies out of which springs rolling cool-
ness along replenish without fail the boundless sea, she has bodies out
of which fires rise up ς for in many spots the earth's crust is on fire and
burns, though headstrong Aetna rages with fires of surpassing force.
Then too she has bodies out of which she can raise for mankind goodly
crops and joyous trees, out of which too she can supply to the mountain-
ranging race of wild beasts rivers leaves and glad pastures. ῃ Wherefore
she has alone been named great mother of gods and mother of beasts
and parent of our body.
