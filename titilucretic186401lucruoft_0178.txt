nunc ea quae nobis membrorum dextera pars est,
in speculis fit ut in laeva videatur eo qued
planitiem ad speculi veniens cum effendit image,
non convertitur incolumiS, sed recta retrorsum 295
sic eliditur, ut siquiS‚ prius arida quam sit
cretea persona, adlidat pilaeve trabive,
atque ea continuo rectam si fronte figuram
32 3 servet et elisam retro sese exprimat ipsa.
fiet ita, ante oculus fuerit qui dexter, ut idem 300
325 nunc sit laeVUS, et e laevo sit mutua dexter.
fit queque de speculo in speculum ut tradatur image,
quinque etiam sexve ut fieri simulacra suerint.
’“ nam quaecumque retro parte interiere latebunt,
inde tamen, quamvis terte penitusque remota, 305
330 omnia per flexos aditus educta licebit
,. pluribus haec speculis videantur in aedibus esse.
usque adeo speculo in speculum translucet image,
et cum laeva data est, fit rusum ut dextera fiat,
inde retro rursum redit et convertitur eedem. 310
335 quin etiam quaecumque latuscula sunt speculorum.
adsimili lateris flexura praedita nostri,
dextera ea prepter nobis simulacra remittunt,
aut quia de speculo in speculum transfertur image,

To preceed, the right side of our body is seen in mirrors te be 011 the
left, because when the image comes and strikes 011 the plane of the
mirrer, it is net turned back unaltered, but is beaten out in a right line
backwardS, just as if you were to take a plaster mask before it is dry and
dash it 011 a pillar or beam, and it forthwith were to preserve the lines
of its features undistorted in frent and were te strike out an exact copy
of- itself straight backwards. The result will be that the eye which was

right will now be left 3 and conversely the left become the right. An -

image may also be se transmitted from 0110 11111101 to another that five or
,ο six idels are often produced. And thus all the things which lurk in
the inmest corners of a house, however far they are withdrawn into
tortuous recesseS, may yet be all brought out through winding passages
·‚- by the aid ef a number of mirrors and be seen to be in the house. So

L unfailingly does the misum reflect itself from mirror te mirror3 and

when the left side is presented, it becomes the right in the new image 3
then it is changed back again and turns round to its former condition.
Mereever all mirrors which form little sides possessing a curvature
resembling our side, send back to us idols with their right corresponding
to our right either because theimage is transmitted from ene mirror to
