gods and the sacred lots. They are barren sometimes from the too
great thickness of the seed, sometimes from its undue fluidity and thin-
ness: because the thin is unable to get a firm hold on the right spots, it
at once passes away and is repelled and withdrawn abortively: since by
others again a too thick seed is discharged in a state more solid than is
suitable‚ it either does not fiy forth with so prolonged a stroke or can-
not equally pass into the proper spots or when it has passed in with
difficulty mixes with the woman's seed. For well-assorted matches are
found to be of great importance 3 and some males impregnate some
females more readily than others, and other females conceive and be-
come pregnant more readily from other males. And many women have
hitherto been barren during several marriages and have yet 111 the end
found mates from whom they could conceive children and be enriched
with a sweet offspring. And often even for those, to whom hitherto
wives however fruitful had been unable in their house to bear, has been
found a compatible nature, enabling them to fortify their age with sons.
Of such great importance is it, in order that seeds may agree and blend
with seeds in a way to promote birth, whether the thick comes into
contact with the fiuid and the fiuid with the thick. And on this point
it matters much 011 what diet life is supported ς for by some foods seed
