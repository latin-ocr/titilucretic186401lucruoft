ut lapides aut ut fumus constare nequirent

nec cohibere nives gelidas et grandinis imbris,

dant etiam sonitum patuli super aequora mundi,

carbasus ut quondam magnis intenta theatrisw

dat crepitum malos inter iactata trabesque, 110

interdum perscissa furit petulantibus auris

et fragilis sonitus chartarum commeditatur.

id quoque enim genus in tonitru cognoscere possiS,

aut ubi suspensam vestem chartasve volantis

verberibus venti versant planguntque per auras, 1 15

fit quoque enim interdum ut non tam concurrere nubes

frontibus adversis possint quam de latere ire

diverso motu radentes corpora tractim,

aridus unde auris terget sonus ille diuque

ducitur, exierunt donec regionibus artis, 120
Hoc etiam pacto tonitru concussa videntur

omnia saepe gravi tremere et divolsa repente

maxima dissiluisse capacis moenia mundi,

cum subito validi venti conlecta procella

nubibus intorsit sese conclusaque ibidem 125

turbine versanti magis ac magis undique nubem

weight like stones, or like smoke they would be unable to keep together
and hold within frozen snows and hail—showers. They also give forth a
sound over the levels of the wide-stretching upper world, just as at
times a canvas-awning stretched over large theatres makes a creaking
noise, when it tosses about among the poles and beams 3 sometimes too
rent by the boisterous gales it madly howls and closely imitat-es the
crackling noise of pieces of paper: this kind of noise too you may notice
in thunder, when the winds whirl about with their blows and buffet
through the air a hanging eloth or flying bits of paper. For sometimes
too the clouds cannot meet front to front in direct collision, but must
rather move from the flank and so with contrary motions graze leisurely
’ along each other’s bodies3 whence comes that dry sound which brushes
the ears and is long drawn out, until they have made their way out of
their confined positions.

In this way also all things appear to quake osten from the shock of
heavy thunder, and the mighty walls of the far-stretching ether seem in
an instant to have been riven and to have sprung asunder3 when a
storm of violent wind has suddenly gathered and worked itself into the
clouds and, there shut in, with its whirling eddy ever more and more on
all sides forces the cloud to become hollow with a thick surrounding
