III 129

cassum anima corpus durare et sensibus uti.

scilicet avolsus radicibus ut nequit ullam

dispicere ipse oculus rem seorsum corpore tot0â€š

sic anima atque animus per se nil posse videtur. 565

nimirum quia per venas et viscera mixtim,
per nervos atque ossa, tenentur corpore ab omni

nec magnis intervallis primordia possunt

libera dissultare, ideo conclusa moventur

sensiferos motus quos extra corpus in auras 570
aeris haut possunt post mortem eiecta moveri

propterea quia non simili ratione tenentur.
corpus enim atque animans erit aer, si cohibere

sese anima atque in eo poterit concludere motus

quos ante in nervis et in ipso corpore agebat. 575
quare etiam atque etiam resoluto corporis omni

tegmine et eiectis extra vitalibus auris

dissolui sensus animi fateare necessest

atque animam, quoniam coniunctast causa duobus,
Denique cum corpus nequeat perferre animai 580

discidium quin in taetro tabescat odore,
quid dubitas quin ex imo penitusque coorta
emanarit uti fumus diffusa animae viS,

bereft of the soul continue to exist and make use of its senses: just, you
are to know, as the eye itself torn away from its roots cannot see any-
thing when apart from the whole body, thus the soul and mind cannot
it is plain do anything by themselves. Sure enough, because mixed up
through veins and flesh, sinews and bones, their first-beginnings are
confined by all the body and are not free to bound away leaving great
spaces between, therefore thus shut in they make those sense-giving
motions which they cannot make after death when forced out of the
body into the air by reason that they are not then confined in a like
manner 3 for the air will be a body and a living thing, if the 80111 shall
be able to keep itself together and to enclose in it those motions which
it used before to perform in the sinews and within the body. Therefore,
again and again I say, when the enveloping body has been all broken up
and the vital airs have been forced out, you must admit that the senses
of the mind and the 80111 are dissolved, since the cause of destruction is
one and inseparable for both body and soul.

Again since the body is unable to bear the separation of the soul
without rotting away in a noisome stenoh, why doubt that the power of
the soul gathering itself up from the inmost depths of body has oozed out
