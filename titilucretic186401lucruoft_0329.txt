nonne vides etiam, nocturna ad lumina linum 900
nuper ubi extinctum admoveaS, accendier ante
quam tetigit flammam, taedamque pari ratione?
multaque praeterea prius ipso tacta vapore
eminus ardescunt quam comminus imbuat igniS.
hoc igitur fieri quoque in illo fonte putandumst. 905
Quod superest, agere incipiam quo foedere fiat
naturae, lapis hic ut ferrum ducere possit,
quem Magneta vocant patrio de nomine Grai,
Magnetum quia fit patriis in finibus ortus
hunc homines la‘pidem mirantur3 quippe catenam 910
saepe ex anellis reddit pendentibus ex se.
quinque etenim licet interdum pluresque videre
ordine demissos levibus iactarier auris,
unus ubi ex uno dependet supter adhaerens
ex alioque alius lapidis vim vinclaque noscit: 915
usque adeo permananter vis *pervolat eius,
Hoc genus in rebus firmandumst multa prius quam
ipsius rei rationem reddere possis,
et nimium longis ambagibus est adeundum3
quo magis attentas auris animumque reposco, 920
Principio omnibus ab rebUS‚ quascumque videmUS,

a newly extinguished wick near night-lamps, it catches light before it
has touched the flame ‚- and the same with the pinewood‘l And many
things beside catch fire at some distance touched merely by the heat, be-
fore the fire in actual contact infects them. This therefore you must
suppose to take place in that fountain.

N ext in order Ι will proceed to discuss by what law of nature it
comes to pass that iron can be attracted by that stone which the Greeks
call the Magnet from the name of its native place, because it has its
origin within the bounds of the country of the Magnesians. This stone
men wonder at3 as it often produces a chain of rings hanging down
from it. Thus you may see sometimes five and more suspended in suc-
cession and tossing about in the light airs, one always hanging down
from one and attached to its lower side, and each in turn one from the
other experiencing the binding power of the stone: with such a con-
tinued current its force flies through all.

In things of this kind many points must be established before you
can assign the true law of the thing in question, and it must be ap-
proached by a very circuitous road 3 wherefore all the more I call for an
attentive ear and mind.

In the first place from all things whatsoever which we see there
