they pass entire into a fresh body, yet in oozing through it are dissolved,
whilst there are transmitted so to say into the frame through all
the cavities those particles of which this nature of mind is formed,
which now is sovereign in our body, being born out of that 80111 which

Again are seeds of the soul left in the dead body or not? If they
are left and remain in it, the 80111 cannot fairly be deemed immortal,
