first-beginnings, because there is no lowest point at all, 10 which they
might stream together as it were, and where they might take up their
positions. All things are ever going on in ceaseless motion from all
quarters and bodies of matter stirred to action are supplied from beneath
out of infinite space. Therefore the nature of room and the space of
the imfathomable void, is such as bright thunderbolts cannot 1606

Again nature keeps the sum of things from setting any limit to itself,

that either she thus renders the universe infinite by this alternation of the
two, or else the one of the two, in case the other does not bound it, with
its single nature stretches nevertheless immeasurably. [But void I have
⁸ already proved to be infinite; therefore matter must be infinite : for if void
were infinite, and matter finite] neither sea nor earth nor the glittering
