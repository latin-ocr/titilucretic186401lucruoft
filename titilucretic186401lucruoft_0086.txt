Quod quoniam docui, pergam conectere rem quae
ex 1100 apta fidem ducat, primordia rerum,
inter se simili quae sunt perfecta figura,
infinita cluere. etenim distantia cum sit 525
formarum finita, necesse est quae similes sint

Now since these things are not so, but a fixed limit has been assigned
to things which bound their sum on each side, you must admit that
matter also has a finite number of different shapes. Once more from
summer fires to chill frosts a definite path is traced out and in like
manner is again travelled back ; for cold and heat lie on the outside,
and moderate warmths midway between both, filling up in succession
the sum. Therefore things produced differ by finite degrees, since on
each side they are marked off by points, one at one, another at the
other end, molested on the one ‘hand by flames, on the other by stiffening
frosts.

And now that I have shewn this, I will go on to link to it a truth
which depends on this and from this draws its preof ε 1116 first-beginnings
of things which have a like shape one with the other, are infinite in
number. For since the difference of forms 15 finite, those which are like
must be infinite or the sum of matter will be finite, which Ι proved not
10 be the case, when-I shewed in my verses that the minute bodies of
matter froin everlasting continually uphold the sum of things through an
uninterrupted succession of blows on all sides. For though you see that
some animals are rarer than others and discern a less fruitful nature in
