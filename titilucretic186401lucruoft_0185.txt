bina lucernarum florentia lumina flammis 450
binaque per totas aedis geminare supellex
et duplicis hominum facies et corpora bina.
denique cum suavi devinxit membra sopore
somnus et in summa corpus iacet omne quiete,
tum vigilare tamen nobis et membra movere 455
nostra videmur, et in noctis caligine caeca
cernere censemus solem lumenque diurnum,
conclusoque loco caelum mare flumina montis
mutare et campos pedibus transire videmur,
et sonitus audire, severa silentia noctis 460
undique cum constent, et reddere dicta tacentes,

quae violare fidem quasi sensibus omnia quaerunt,

on foot and to hear noises‚ though the austere silence of night prevails
all round, and to be uttering speech though quite silent. Many are the
other things of this marveHous sort we see, which all seek to shake as

these cases cheats us on account of the mental suppositions which we

by the senses. For nothing is harder than to separate manifest facts
from doubtful which the mind without hesitation adds on of itself.

Again if a man believe that nothing 10 known, he knows not whether
this even can be known, since he admits he knows nothing. I will
