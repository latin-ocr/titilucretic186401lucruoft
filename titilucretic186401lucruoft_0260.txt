sed quia finem aliquam pariendi debet habere,
destitit, ut mulier spatio defessa vetusto,
, mutat enim mundi naturam totius aetas
ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet,
nec manet ulla sui similis res: omnia migrant, 830
omnia commutat natura et vertere cogit.
namque aliut putrescit et aevo debile languet,
porro aliut clarescit et e contemptibus exit.
sic igitur mundi naturam totius aetas
mutat et ex alio terram status excipit alter, 835
quod pote uti nequeat, possit quod non tulit ante.

One thing crumbles away and is worn and enfeebled with age, then
another comes unto honour and issues out of its state of contempt. In
this way then time changes the nature of the whole world and the earth
passes out of one condition into another, so that now it cannot bear what
once it could, and now it can bea-1Î‡ what before it did not bear.

And many monsters too the earth at that time essayed to produce,
things coming up with with strange face and limbs, the man-woman, a thing
between the two and neither the one sex nor the other, widely differ-ing
from both 3 some things deprived of feet, others again destitute of hands,
others too proving dumb without mouth, or blind without eyes, and things
bound fast by the adhesion of their limbs over all the body, so that they
could not do anything nor go anywhere nor avoid the evil nor take what
their needs required. Every other monster and portent of this kind she
would produce, but all in vain, since nature set a ban on their increase
and they could not reach the coveted flower of age nor find food nor be
