206 IV

nec ratione alia volucres armenta feraeque
et pecudes et equae maribus subsidere possent,
‘ γ si non, ipsa quod illorum subat ardet abundans
natura et Venerem salientum laeta retractat. 1200
nonne vides etiam quos mutua saepe voluptas
vinxit, ut in vinclis communibus excrucientur?
in triviis quam saepe caneS, discedere aventiS,
1210 divorsi cupide summis ex viribu’ tendunt,

1204 quom interea validis Veneris compagibus haerent! 1205
quod facerent numquam nisi mutua gaudia nossent
quae iacere in fraudem possent vinctosque tenere.
quare etiam atque etiam, ut dico, est communi' voluptas,

Et commiscendo quom semine forte virili

1209 femina vim vicit subita vi corripuitque, 1210
tum similes matrum materno semine fiunt,

ut patribus patrio, sed quos utriusque figurae
esse videS‚ iuxtim miscentes vulta parentum,

corpore de patrio et materno sanguine crescunt,

semina cum Veneris stimulis excita per artus 1215
obvia conflixit conspirans mutuus ardor,

et neque utrum superavit eorum nec superatumst.

race of love. And in no other way could birds cattle wild-beasts sheep
and mares submit to bear the males, except because the very exuberance
of nature in the females is in heat and burns and joyously draws in the
Venus of the covering males. See you not too how those whom mutual
pleasure has chained are often tortured in their common chains 2 How
often in the highways do dogs, desiring to separate, eagerly pull different
ways with all their might, while all the time they are held fast in the
strong setters of Venus ἔ This they would never do, unless they
experienced mutual joys, strong enough to force them into the snare and
hold them in its meshes. Wherefore again and again I repeat there is a
common pleasure.

And when haply in mixing her seed with the man’s the woman by
sudden force has overpowered and seized for herself his force, then
children are formed from the mothers’ seed like to the mothers, as from
the fathers’ seed like to the fathers. But those whom you see with a
share of both formS‚ blending equally the features of the parents, grow
from the union of the father's body and the mother’s blood, when the
mutual ardour of desire working in concert has brought and‘clashed
together the seeds roused throughout the frame by the goads of Venus 3
and neither of the two has gotten the mastery nor has been mastered.
