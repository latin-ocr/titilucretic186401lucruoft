quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;

porro aliut succedit et e contemptibus exit

Nunc tibi quo pacto ferri natura reperta

sit facilest ipsi per te cognoscere, Memmi.

and is in marvellous repute with men.

And now, Memmius, it is easy for you to find out by yourself in what
way the nature of iron was discovered. Arms of old were hands nails
and teeth and stones and boughs broken off from the forestS, and flame
and fire, as soon as they had become known. Afterwards the force of
iron and copper was discovered ,- and the use of copper was known before
that of iron, as its nature is easier to work and it is found in greater
quantity. With copper they would labour the soil of the earth, with
copper stir up the billows of war and deal about wide-gaping wounds
and seize cattle and lands 3 for every thing defenceless and unarmed
would readily yield to them with arms in hand. Then by slow steps the
sword of iron gained ground and the make of the copper sickle became a
byword 3 and with iron they began to plough through the earth's soil,
and the struggles ofwavering war were rendered equal. And the custom
