aut procul apsih'ebat, ut acrem exeiret odorem,

aut, ubi gustarat, languebat morte propinqua.

nec tamen omnino temere illis solibus ulla

comparebat aviS, nec tristia saecla ferarum 1220
exeibant silvis languebant pleraque morbo

et moriebantur. cum primis fida canum vis

strata viis animam ponebat in omnibus aegre3
extorquebat enim vitam vis morbida membris,
[incomitata rapi certabant funera vasta] 1225
nec ratio remedi communis certa dabatur3

nam quod ali dederat vitalis aeris auras
volvere in 010 110010 et caeli templa tueri,
hoc aliis erat exitio letumque parabat.
illud in his rebus miserandum magnopere unum 1230
aerumnabile erat, quod ubi se quisque videbat
implicitum morbo, morti damnatus ut esset,
deficiens animo maesto cum corde iacebat,
funera respectans animam amittebat ibidem.
quippe etenim nullo cessabant tempore apisci 1235
ex aliis alios avidi contagia morbi,
1245 lanigeras tamquam pecudes et bucera saecla.
1237 idque vel in primis cumulabat funere funus,
nam quicumque suos fugitabant visere ad aegrOS,

far away, to escape the acrid stench, or where any one had tasted, it
drooped in near-following death. Though hardly at all in those days
would any bird appear, or the sullen breeds of wild-beasts quit the
forests. Many would droop with disease and die: above all faithful dogs
would lie stretched in all the streets and yield up breath with a struggle 3
for the power of disease would wrench life from their frame. Funerals
lonely, unattended, would be hurried on with emulous haste. And no
sure and universal method of cure was found 3 for that which had given
to one man the power to inhale the vital air and to gaze on the quarters
of heaven, would be destruction to others and would bring on death.
But in such times this was what was deplorable and above all eminently
beart-rending: when a man saw himself enmeshed by the disease, as
though he were doomed to death, losing all spirit he would lie with
sorrow-stricken heart, and with his thoughts turned on death would sur-
render his life then and there. Ay for at no time did they cease to catch
from one another the infection of the devouring plague, like to woolly
flocks and horned herds. And this above all heaped death on death:
whenever any refused to attend their own sickâ€š killing neglect soon after
