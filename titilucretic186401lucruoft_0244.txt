neither earth has taken unto itself nor greatest ether, because they were
neither heavy enough to sink and settle down nor light enough to glide
along the uppermost borders3 they yet however are so placed between
the two as to wheel along their life· like bodies and yet to be parts of the
whole world, just as in 118 801118 members may be at rest, while others

of its body increase by its oozings the sea and floating fields, and ever
