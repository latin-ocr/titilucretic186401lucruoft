eiciatur et introrsum pars abdita cedat, 945
pars etiam distracta per artus non queat esse
coniuncta inter se neque motu mutua fungi3
inter enim saepit coetus natura viasque;
ergo sensus abit mutatis motibus alte.
et quoniam non est quasi quod suffulciat artus, 950
debile fit corpus languescuntque omnia membra,
bracchia palpebraeque cadunt poplitesque cubanti
saepe tamen summittuntur virisque resolvunt.
deinde cibum sequitur somnuS‚ quia, quae facit aer,
haec eadem cibus, in venas dum diditur 01111118, 955

quem satur aut lassus capiaS, quia plurima 1311111 86
corpora conturbant magno contusa labore.
fit ratione eadem coniectus partim animai

scattered about through the frame cannot get united together and so
act and be acted upon by motion3 for nature intercepts all communica-
tion and blocks up all the passages 3 and therefore sense retires deep
into the frame as the motions are all altered. And since there is
nothing as it were to lend support to the frame‚ the body becomes weak
and all the limbs are faint, the arms and eyelids droop and the hams
even in bed often give way under you and relax their powers. Then
sleep follows on food, because food produces just the same effects as
air, while 113 18 distributed into all the veins ,· and that sleep is much
the heaviest which you take when full or tired, because then the
greatest number of bodies fall into disorder‚ bruised by much exertion.
On the same principle the soul comes in part to be forced more deeply
into the frame, and there is also a more copious emission of it abroad,
and at ‚the same time itis more divided and scattered in itself within
you.

And generally to whatever pursuit a man is closely tied down and
strongly attached, on whatever subjects we have previously much dwelt,
the mind having been put to a more than usual strain in it, in sleep we
sor the most part fancy that we are engaged in the same 3 lawyers think
