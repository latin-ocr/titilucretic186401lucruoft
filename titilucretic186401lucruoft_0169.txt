consimiles ideo diffusae e rebus abundant,

ex alto quia dum veniunt intrinsecus ortae,

scinduntur per iter flexum, 1160 recta viarum

ostia sunt qua contendant exire coortae.

at contra tenuis summi membrana coloris 95
cum iacitur, nil est quod 66111 discerpere possit,

in promptu quoniam est in prima fronte locata.
postremo speculis in aqua splendoreque in omni
quaecumque apparent nobis simulacra, necessest,

quandoquidem simili specie sunt praedita rerum 100
extima, imaginibus missis consistere rerum.
sunt igitur tenues formae rerum similesque 104

effigiae‚ singillatim quas cernere nemo

cum possit tamen, adsiduo crebroque repulsu
reiectae reddunt speculorum ex aequore visum,
1160 ratione alia servari posse videntur,

tanto ⁴opere ut similes reddantur cuique figurae.
Nunc age quam tenui natura constet imago 110

such—like things stream off things in a state of diffusion, because while
they are coming from the depths of the body having arisen within it,
they are torn in their winding passage, and there are no straight orifices
to the paths, for them to make their way out by in a mass. But on the
other hand when a thin fflm of surface colour is discharged, there is
nothing to rend it, since it is ready to hand stationed in front rank.
Lastly in the case of all idols which show themselves to us in mirrors
water or any other shining object, since their outsides are possessed of
an appearance like to the things they represent, they must be formed of
emitted images of things. There are therefore thin shapes and pictures
like to the things which, though no one can see them one at a time, yet
when thrown off by constant and repeated reflexion give back a visible
image from the plane surface of mirrors 3 and in no other way it would
seem can they be kept so entire that shapes are given back so exceedingly
like each object.

Now mark, and learn how thin the nature of an image is. And
first of all, since the first-beginnings are so far below the ken of our
senses and much smaller than the things which our eyes begin to be un-

able to see, to strengthen yet more the proof of this aISO, learn in a few
