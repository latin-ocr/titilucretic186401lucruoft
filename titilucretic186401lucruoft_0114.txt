et fulcire cibuS, cibus omnia sustentare, 1 140
nequiquam, quoniam nec venae perpetiuntur
quod satis est neque quantum opus est natura ministrat.
1139 iure igitur pereunt, cum rarefacta fluendo
sunt et cum externis succumbunt omnia plagis,
quandoquidem grandi cibus aevo denique defit 1145
nec tuditantia rem cessant extrinsecus ullam·
corpora conficere et plagis infesta domare.
sic igitur magni quoque circum moenia mundi
1145 expugnata dabunt labem putrisque ruinas
iamque adeo fracta est aetas effetaque tellus 1 150
vix animalia parva creat quae cuncta creavit
saecla deditque ferarum ingentia corpora partu.
haud, ut opinor, enim mortalia saecla superne
aurea de caelo demisit funis in arva
nec mare nec fluctus plangentis saxa crearunt, 1155
sed genuit tellus eadem quae nunc alit ex se.
praeterea nitidas fruges vinetaque laeta
sponte sua primum mortalibus ipsa creavit,
ipsa dedit dulcis fetus et pabula laeta3
quae nunc vix nostro grandescunt aucta labore, 1160

conficimus ferrum vix arvis suppeditati:

keep all things entire by renewing them, food must uphold, food sustain
all things: all in vain, since the arteries refuse to hold what is sufficient,
and nature does not furnish the needful amount. With good reason
therefore all things pei-ish, when they have been rarefied by the ebb of
particles and succumb to blows from without, since food sooner or later
fails advanced age, and bodies never cease to destroy a thing by thump-
ing it from without and to overpower it by aggressive blows. In this way
then the walls too of the great world around shall be stormed and fall
to decay and crumbling ruin. Yes and even now the age is enfeebled
and the earth exhausted by bearing scarce produces little living crea-
tures, she who produced all races and gave birth to the huge bodies
of wild beasts. For methinks no golden chain let down to earth from
heaven above the races of mortal beings, nor did tlie sea and waves
which lash the rocks produce them, but the same earth bare them which
now feeds them from herself. Moreover she first spontaneously of her-
self produced for mortals goodly corn-crops and joyous vineyards 3 of her-
self gave sweet fruits and joyous pastures 3 which now-a-days scarce attain
any size when furthered by our labour: we exhaust the oxen and the
strength of the husbandmen 3 we wear out our iron, §carce equalfflto thes
