formai speciem totius corporis eiuS‚ 490
quod superest, si forte voles variare figuras,

addendum partis alias erit, inde sequetur,

adsimili ratione alias ut postulet ord0,

si tu forte voles etiam variare figuras:

ergo formarum novitatem corporis augmen 495
subsequitur. quare non est ut credere possis

esse infinitis distantia semina formiS,

ne quaedam cogas inmani maximitate

esse, supra quod iam docui non posse probari.

iam tibi barbaricae vestes Meliboeaque fulgens 500
purpura Thessalico concharum tacta colore

aurea pavonum ridenti imbuta lepore
saecla, novo rerum superata colore iacerent

et contemptus odor smyrnae mellisque saporeS,

et cycnea mele Phoebeaque daedala chordis 505
carmina consimili ratione oppressa silerent ;

namque aliis aliud praestantius exoreretur.

cedere item retro possent in deteriores

omnia sic partiS‚ ut diximus in mel-ioris3

namque aliis aliud retro quoque taetrius esset 510
naribus auribus atque oculis orisque sapori.

first body and found what manner of shape each different arrangement
gives to the whole of that body, if after all this haply you shall wish still
to vary the shapes‚ you will have to add other parts t it will next follow
that for like reasons the arrangement will require other partS, if haply
you shall wish still again to vary the shapes z—from all this it results that
increase of bulk in the body follows upon newness of the shapes‚ Where-
fore you cannot possibly believe that seeds have an infinite variety of
forms, lest you force some to be of a monstrous hugenesS, which as I
have above shewn cannot be proved. Moreover I tell you barbaric robes
and radiant Meliboean purple dipped in Thessalian dye of shells [and
the hues which are displayed] by} the golden brood of peacocks steeped
in laughing beauty would all b'e' thrown aside sui-passed by some new
colour of things 3 the smell of myrrh would be despised and the flavours
of honey, and the melodies of the swan and Phoebean tunes set off by
the varied play of strings would in like sort be suppressed and silenced;
for something ever would arise more surpassing than the rest. All
things likewise might fall back into worse states, even as we have said
they might advance to better3 for reversely too one thing would be
more noisome than all other things to nostri] ear and eye and taste.
