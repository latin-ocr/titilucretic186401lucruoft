caudaque pavonis, larga cum luce repleta est,

blend with coral-red green emeralds. The tail of the peacock when it
is saturated with abundant light, changes in like fashion its colours as
it faces the sun. And since these colours are begotten by a certain
stroke of light, sure enough you must believe that they cannot be pro-
duced without it. And since the pupil receives into it a kind of blow,
when it is said to perceive a white colour‚ and then another, when it
perceives black or any other colour, and since it is of no moment with
what colour the things which you touch are provided, but rather with
what sort of shape they are furnished, you are to know that first-
beginnings have no need of colours, but give forth sensations of touch
varying according to their various shapes.

Moreover since no ,particular kind of colour is assigned to particular
shapes and every configuration of first-beginnings can exist in any
colour‚ why on a like principle are not the things which are formed out
of them in every kind o’erlaid with colours of every kind? For then
it were natural that crows too in flying should display a white colour
from white wings and that swans should come to be black from a black
seed, or of any other colour you please, uniform or diversified.
