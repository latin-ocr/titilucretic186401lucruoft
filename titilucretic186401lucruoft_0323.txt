VI 311,

Principio hoc dico, quod dixi saepe quoque ante,
in terra cuiusque modi rerum esse figuras; 770
multa, cibo quae sunt, vitalia, multaque, morbos
incutere et mortem quae possint adcelerare.
et magis esse aliis alias animantibus aptas
res ad vitai rationem ostendimus ante
propter dissimilem naturam dissimilisque 775
. texturas inter sese primasque figuras
multa meant inimica per auris, multa per ipsas
insinuant naris infesta atque aspera iactu,
nec sunt multa parum tactu vitanda neque autem
aspectu fugienda saporeque tristia quae sint. 780
Deinde videre licet quam multae sint homini res
acriter infesto sensu spurcaeque gravesque3
arboribus primum certis gravis umbra tributa
usque ade0‚ capitis faciant ut saepe (1010166,
siquis eas supter iacuit prostratus in herbis, 785
est etiam magnis Heliconis montibus arbos
floris odore hominem taetro consueta necare.
scilicet haec ideo terris ex omnia surgunt,
multa modis multis multarum semina rerum
quod permixta gerit tellus discretaque tradit. 790

First of all I say, as I have often said before, that in the earth 616
elements of things of every kind: many, which serve for food, helpful
to life 3 and many whose property it is to cause diseases and hasten
death. And we have shewn before that one thing is more adapted to
0116, another thing to another living creature for the purposes of life be-
cause of their natures and their textures and their primary elements
being all unlike the one to the other. Many which are noxious pass
through the ears, many make their way too through the 1106131116, which
616 dangerous and 1161611 when they come in contact 3 and not a few are
130 be shunned by the tcuch‚ and not 6 sew to be avoided by the sight,
and others nauseous in 16616.

Α86111 you may 666 how many things are for man of a virulently
noxious sensation and 616 nauseous and oppressive3 to certain trees for in-
stance has been given so very oppressive a shade that they often cause
headaches when a man has lain down under them extended on the 81666.
There is 6 13166 1300 011 the great hills of Helicon which has the property
of kilh‘ng 6 111611 by the noisome 6061113 of its flower. All these things
you are to know rise up out of the earth, because it contains many seeds

- of many things in many ways mixed up together and gives them out in
