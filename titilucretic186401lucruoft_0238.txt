quare etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur,

nunc etiam augescunt Í¾ nunc addita navigiis sunt

multa, modo organici melicos peperere sonores,

denique natura haec rerum ratioque repertast 3 3 5

nuper, et hanc primus cum primis ipse repertus

nunc ego sum in patrias qui possim vertere voces

quod si forte fuisse antehac eadem omnia crediS,

sed periisse hominum torrenti saecla vapore,

aut cecidisse urbis magno vexamine mundi, 340

aut ex imbribus adsiduis exisse rapaces

per terras amnes atque oppida cooperuisse,

tanto quique magis victus fateare necessest

exitium quoque terrarum caelique futurum.

nam cum res tantis morbis tantisque periclis 345

temptarentur, ibi si tristior incubuisset

causa, darent late cladem magnasque ruinas.

nec ratione alia mortales esse videmur,

inter nos nisi quod morbis aegrescimus isdem

atque illi quos a vita natura removit. 350
Praeterea quaecumque manent aeterna necessust

aut, quia sunt solido cum corpore, respuere ictus

nec penetrare pati sibi quicquam quod queat artas

its commencement. Wherefore even now some arts are receiving their
last polish, some are even in course of growth 3 just now many improve-
ments have been made in ships, only yesterday musicians have given
birth to tuneful melodies 3 then too this nature and system of things has
been discovered lately, and I the very first of all have only now been
found able to transfer it into native words. But if haply you believe
that before this all things have existed just the same, but that the gene-
rations of men have pei-ished by burning heat, or that cities have fallen
by some great concussion of the world, or that after constant rains
devouring rivers have gone forth over the earth and have whelmcd
towns, so much the more you must yield and admit that there will be
entire destruction too of earth and heaven 3 for when things were tried
by so great distempers and so great dangerS, at that time had a more
disastrous cause pressed upon them, they would far and wide have gone
to destruction and mighty ruin. And in no other way are we proved to
be mortals, except because we all alike in turn fall sick of the same
diseases which those had whom nature has withdrawn from life.

Again whatever things last for ever, must either, because they are
of solid body, repel strokes and not suffer aught to pass into them,
