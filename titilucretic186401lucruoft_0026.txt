repeated assaults‚ sometimes catch them up in cul-ling eddy and carry
them away in swift-circling whirl. Wherefore once and again I say
winds are unseen bodies, since in their works and ways they are found
to rival great rivers which are of a visible body. Then again we per·

nostrils3 nor do we behold heats nor can we observe cold with the
eyes nor are we used to see voices. Yet all· these things must consist
of a bodily nature, since they are able to affect the senses 3 for nothing
but body can touch and be touched. Again clothes hung up on a shore
which waves break upon become moist, and then get dry if spread out
in the sun. Yet it has not been seen in what way the moisture of
water has sunk into them nor again in what way this has been dispelled
by heat. The moisture therefore is dispersed into small particles
which the eyes are quite unable to see. Again after the revolution of
many years a ring on the finger is thinned on the under side by wearing,
the dripping from the eaves hollows a stone, the bent ploughshare of
