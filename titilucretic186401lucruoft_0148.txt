136 III

expirant atque unde animantum copia tanta 720
exos et exanguis tumidos perfluctuat artus?

quod si forte animas extrinsecus insinuari

vermibus et privas in corpora posse venire

credis nec reputas cur milia multa animarum

conveniant unde una recesserit, hoc tamen est ut 725
quaerendum videatur et in discrimen agendum,

utrum tandem animae venentur semina quaeque
vermiculorum ipsaeque sibi fabricentur ubi sint,

an quasi corporibus perfectis insinuentur.
at neque cur faciant ipsae quareve laborent 730

dicere suppeditat. neque enim, sine corpore cum sunt,
sollicitae volitant morbis alguque fameque3

corpus enim magis his vitiis adfine laborat
et mala multa animus contage fungitur eius„

sed tamen his esto quamvis facere utile corpus, 735

cum subeant3 at qua possint via nulla videtur.
haut igitur faciunt animae sibi corpora et artus,

nec tamen est quidum perfectis insinuentur

corporibus3 neque enim poterunt suptiliter esse
conexae neque consensus contagia fient. 740

Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum

now rank fiesh and whence does such a swarm of living things, boneless
and bloodless‚ surge through the heaving frame‘l But if haply you be-
lieve that souls find their way into worms from without and can severally
pass each into a body and you make no account of why many thousands
of souls meet together in a place from which one has withdraw, this
question at least must, it seems, be raised and brought to a decisive test,
whether souls hunt out the several seeds of worms and build for them-
selves a place to dwell in, or find their way into bodies fully formed so
to say. But why they should on their part make a body or take such
trouble, cannot be explained ; since being without a body they are not
plagued as they flit about with diseases and cold and hunger: the body
indeed is more akin to, more troubled by such infirmitieS, and by its
, contact with it the mind suffers many ills. Nevertheless be it ever so
'expedient for them to make a body, when they are going to enter, yet

clearly there is no way by which they can so do. Therefore souls do
not make for themselves bodies and limbs 3 no nor is there any mode
by which they can find their way into bodies after they are fully formed;
for they will neither be able to unite themselves with a nice precision
nor will any connexion of mutual sensation be formed between them.
Again why does untamed fierceness go along with the sullen brood
