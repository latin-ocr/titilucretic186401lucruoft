cum mare versamur propter, dilutaque contra
cum tuimur misceri absinthia, tangit amaror.
usque adeo omnibus ab rebus res quaeque fluenter 225
fertur et in cunctas dimittitur undique partis
. nec mora nec requies interdatur ulla fluendi,
perpetuo quoniam sentimuS, et omnia semper
cernere odorari licet et sentire sonare.

Praeterea quoniam manibus tractata figura 230
in tenebris quaedam cognoscitur esse eadem quae
cernitur in luce et claro candore, necessest
consimili causa tactum visumque moveri.
nunc igitur si quadratum temptamus et id nos
commovet in tenebris, in luci quae poterit res 235
accidere ad speciem quadrata, nisi eius imago‘.l
esse in imaginibus quapropter causa videtur
cernundi neque posse sine his res ulla videri.
nunc ea quae dico rerum simulacra feruntur
undique et in cunctas iaciuntur didita partis3 240
verum nos oculis quia solis cernere quimuS,
propterea fit uti, speciem quo vertimuS, omnes
res ibi eam contra feriant forma atque colore.
et quantum quaeque ab nobis res absit, imago
efficit ut videamus et internoscere curat; 245

the sea 3 and when weffllooksson at the mixing of a decoction of worm-
wood, its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream from all these
things the several qualities are carried and are transmitted in all direc-
tions round, and no delay, no respite in the flow is ever granted, since
we constantly have feeling, and may at any time see smell and hear the
sound of anything.

Again since a particular figure felt by the hands in the dark is known
to be the same which is seen in the bright light of day, touch and sight
must be excited by a quite similar cause. Well then if we handle a
square thing and it excites our attention in the dark, in the day-light
what square thing will be able to fall on our sight, except the image of
that thing 2 Therefore the cause of seeing it is plain lies in images and no
thing can be perceived without them. Well the idols of things Ι speak
of are borne along all round and are discharged and transmitted in all
directions 3 but because we can see with the eyes alone, the consequence
is that, to whatever point we turn our slght, there all the several things
meet and strike it with their shape and colour. And the image gives
the power to see and the means to distinguish how far each thing is
