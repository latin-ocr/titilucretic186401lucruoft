sed quae dissiliunt longe longeque recursant
in magnis inte1·valliS‚ haec aera rarum

sufficiunt nobis et splendida lumina solis.

cuius uti memoro, rei simulacrum et imago
ante oculos semper nobis versatur et instat.
, contemplator enim, cum solis lumina cumque

great spaces between, these furnish us with thin air and bright sunlight.
And many more trave] along the great void, which have been thrown
off from the uniens of things or though admitted have yet in no case
been able likewise to assimilate their motions. Of this truth‚ even as I
relate it, we have a representation and picture always going on before
our eyes and present to us: observe whenever the rays are let in and
pour the sunlight through the dark chambers of houses: you will see
many minute bodies in many ways through the apparent void mingle in
the midst of the light of the rays, and as in never-ending conflict skirmish
and give battle combating in troops and never halting, driven about in
frequent meetings and partings 3 so that you may guess from this, what
it is for first-beginnings of things to be ever tossing about in the great
void. So far as it goes, a small thing may give an illustration of great
things and put you on the track of knowledge. And for this reason too
it is meet that you should give greater heed to these bodies which are
seen to tumble about in the sun's rays, because such tumblings imply
that motions also of matter latent and unseen are at the bottom. For
