inde alius conatur adempto surgere crure,

cum digitos agitat propter moribundus humi pes,

et caput abscisum calido viventeque trunco

servat humi voltum vitalem oculosque patentiS, 655
donec reliquias animai reddidit omneS.

quin etiam tibi si, lingua vibrante, micanti

serpentis cauda e procero corpore, utrumque

sit libitum in multas partis discidere ferm,

omnia iam sorsum cernes ancisa recenti 660
volnere tortari et terram conspargere tabo,

ipsam seque retro partem petere ore priorem,

volneris ardenti ut morsu premat icta dolorem.

omnibus esse igitur totas dicemus in illis

particulis animas? at ea ratione sequetur 665
unam animantem animas habuisse in corpore multas..
ergo divisast ea quae fuit una simul cum

corpore; quapropter mortale utrumque putandumst,
in multas quoniam partis disciditur aeque.
Praeterea si inmortalis natura animai 670
constat et in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,
cur super anteactam aetatem meminisse nequimus

nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?

his right arm has dropped from him, while he mounts and presses for-
ward. Another tries to get up after he has lost his leg, while the dying
foot quivers with its toes on the ground close by. The head too when
cut off from the warm and living trunk retains on the ground the ex-
pression of life and open eyes, until it has delivered up all the remnants
of soul. To take another case, if, as a serpent’s tongue is quivering,
as its tail is darting out from its long body, you choose to chop with an
axe into many pieces both tail and body, you will see all the separate
portions thus cut off writhing under the fresh wound and bespattering
the earth with gore, the fore part with the mouth making for its own
hinder part, to allay with burning bite the pain of the wound with
which it has been emitten. Shall we say then that there are entire
souls in all those pieces? why from that argument it will follow that
one living creature had many souls in its body3 and this being absurd,
therefore the soul which was one has been divided together with the
body, therefore each alike must be reckoned mortal, since⁴ each is
alike chopped up into'mauy pieces.

Again if the nature of the soul is immortal and makes its way into
our body at the time of birth, why are we unable to remember besides

the time already gone, and why do we retain no traces of past actions?
