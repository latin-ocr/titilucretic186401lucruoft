omnia perversa praepostera sunt ratione,

nil ideo quoniam natumst in corpore ut uti

possemUS‚ sed quod natumst id procreat usum. 835

nec fuit ante videre oculorum lumina nata

nec dictis orare prius quam lingua creatast‚

sed potius longe linguae praecessit origo

sermonem multoque creatae sunt prius aures

quam sonus est auditus, et omnia denique membra 840

ante fuere, ut opinor, eorum quam foret usus;

haud igitur potuere utendi crescere causa.

at contra conferre manu certamina pugnae

et lacerare artus foedareque membra cruore

ante fuit multo quam lucida tela volarent, 845
, 61 volnus vitare prius natura coegit

quam daret obiectum parmai laeva per artem.

scilicet et fessum corpus mandare quieti

multo antiquius est quam lecti mollia strata,

et sedare sitim prius est quam pocula natum. , 850

11660 1811111 possunt utendi cognita causa

credier‚ ex usu quae sunt vitaque reperta.

illa quidem seorsum sunt omnia quae prius ipsa

nata dedere suae post notitiam utilitatis.

quo genere in primis sensus et membra videmus; 855

one and all put effect for cause through wrongheaded reasoning3 since
nothing was born in the body that we might use it, but that which is
born begets for itself a use: thus seeing did not exist before the eyes
were bom, nor the employment of speech ere the tongue was made 3 but
rather the birth of the tongue was long anterior to language and the
ears were made long before sound was heard, and all the limbs, Ι trow,
existed before there was any employment for them: they could not
therefore have grown for the purpose 01 being used. But on the other
hand engaging in the strife of battle and mangling the body and staining
the limbs with gore were in vogue 10118 before glittering darts ever flew 3
and nature prompted to shun a wound or ever the left arm by the help
of art held up before the person the defence of a shield. Yes and con-
signing the tired body to rest is much older than a soit-cushioned bed,
and the slaking of thirst had birth before cups. These things therefore
which have been invented in accordance with the uses and want-s of life,
may well be believed to have been discovered for the purpose of being
used. Far otherwise is it with all those things which first were born,-
then afterwards made known the purposes to which they might be put 3
at the head of which class we see the senses and the limbs. Wherefore
