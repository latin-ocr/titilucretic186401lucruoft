mind and body are together sunk in sleep3 *for all we care this sleep
might be everlasting‚ no craving whatever for ourselves then moves us.
And yet by no means do those first-beginnings throughout our frame
wander at that time far away from their sense-producing motions, when
a man starts up from sleep and collects himself W Death there-
fore must be supposed to concern us much less, if less there can be than
