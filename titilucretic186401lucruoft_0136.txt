nam velut infirmo pueri teneroque vagantur
corpore, sic animi sequitur sententia tenviS.
inde ubi robustis adolevit viribus 331338,
consilium quoque maius et auctior est animi vis, 450
post ubi iam validis quassatum est viribus aevi
corpus et obtusis ceciderunt viribus artUS‚
claudicat ingenium, delirat lingua, labat mem,
omnia deficiunt atque uno tempore desunt.
ergo dissolui quoque convenit omnem animai 455
naturam, ceu fumUS‚ in altas aeris auras ;
quandoquidem gigni pariter pariterque videmus
crescere et, ut docui, simul aevo fessa fatisci.
Huc accedit uti videamuS, corpus ut ipsum
suscipere inmanis morbos durumque dolorem, 460
sic animum curas acris luctumque metumque3
quare participem leti quoque convenit esse.
quin etiam morbis in corporis avius errat
saepe animus; dementit enim deliraque fatur
interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum 465
aeternumque soporem oculis nutuque cadenti,
unde neque exaudit voces nec noscere voltus
illorum potis est, ad vitam qui revocantes
circumstant lacrimis rorantes ora genasque.

as children go about with a tottering and weakly body, so slender sagacity
of mind follows along with it3 then when their life has reached the

maturity of confirmed strength, the judgment too is greater and the
power of the mind more developed. Afterwards when the body has
been shattered by the mastering might of time and the frame has drooped
with its forces dulled, then the intellect halts, the tongue dotes, the mind
gives away, all faculties fail and are found wanting at the same time.
It naturally follows then that the whole nature of the soul is dissolved‚
like smoke‚ into the high air 3 since we see it is begotten along with the
body and grows up along with it and, as Ι have shown, breaks down at
the same time worn out with age.

Moreover we see that even as the body is liable to violent diseases and
severe pain, so is the mind to sharp cares and grief and sear 3 it naturally
follows therefore that it is its partner in death as well. Again in dis-
eases of the body the mind often wanders and goes astray3 for it loses
its reason and drivels in its speech and often in a profound lethargy is
carried into deep and never-ending sleep with drooping eyes and head 3
out of which it neither hears the voices nor can recognise the faces of
those who stand round calling it back to life and bedewing with tears
