V 219

quid potuit novitatis amorem accendere tali? 175
174 quidve mali fuerat nobis non esse creatis?
177 natus enim debet quicumque est velle manere

in vita, donec retinebit blanda voluptas.

qui numquam vero vitae gustavit amorem

nec fuit in numero, quid obest non esse creatum? 180

exemplum porro gignundis rebus et ipsa
notities divis hominum unde est insita primum,
quid vellent facere ut scirent animoque viderent,
quove modost umquam vis cognita principiorum
quidque inter sese permutato ordine possent, 185
si non ipsa dedit specimen natura creandi?
namque ita multa modis multis primordia rerum
ex infinito iam tempore percita plagis
ponderibusque suis consuerunt concita ferri
omnimodisque coire atque omnia pertemptare, 190
quaecumque inter se possent congressa creare,
ut non sit mirum si in talis disposituras
deciderunt quoque et in talis venere meatUS,
qualibus haec rerum geritur nunc summa novando,
Quod si iam rerum ignorem primordia quae sint, 195
hoc tamen ex ipsis caeli rationibus ausim
confirmare aliisque ex rebus reddere multiS,

change‘l or what evil had it been for us never to have been born?
whoever has been born must want to continue in lise, so long as fond plea-
sure shall keep him 3 but for him who has never tasted the Iove, never
been on the lists, of life, what harm never to have been born? Whence
again was first implanted in the gods a pattern for begetting things in
general as well as the preconceptiou of what men are, so that they knew
and saw in mind what they wanted to make 3 and in what way was the
power of first-beginnings ever ascertained, and what they could effect by
a change in their mutual arrangements‚ unless nature herself gave the
model for making things‘l For in suchwise the first-beginnings of
things many in number in many ways impelled by blows for infinite ages
back and kept in motion by their own weights have been wont to be
carried along and to unite in all manner of ways and thoroughly test
every kind of production possible by their mutual combinations3 that
it is not strange if they have also fallen into arrangements and have
come into courses like to those out of which this sum of things is now
carried on by constant renewing. ·

But if I did not know what first—beginnings of things are, yet this
judging by the very arrangements of heaven I would venture to affirm,
