quam tonitrum accipimus pariter qui mittitur igni
e simili causa, concursu natus eodem.
Hoc etiam pacto volucri loca lumine tingunt
nubes et tremulo tempestas impete fulgit.
ventus ubi invasit nubem et versatus ibidem 175
fecit ut ante cavam docui spissescere nubem,
mobilitate sua fervescit; ut omnia motu
percalefacta vides ardescere, plumbea vero

glans etiam longa cursu volvenda liquescit.

ergo fervidus hic nubem cum perscidit atram, 180
dissipat ardoris quasi per vim expressa repente

semina quae faciunt nictantia fulgura flammae 3

inde sonus sequitur qui tardius adficit auris

quarn quae perveniunt oculorum ad lumina nostra.
scilicet hoc densis fit nubibus et simul alte 185
extructis aliis alias super impete miro;

ne tibi sit frudi quod nos inferne videmus

quam sint lata magis quam sursum extructa quid extent.
contemplator enim, cum montibus adsimulata

before we hear the thunder, which is discharged at the same time from
the same cause, being born indeed from the same collision.

Also in the foHowing manner clouds dye places with winged light
and the storm flashes out with a rapid quivering movement. When the
wind has made its way into a cloud and whirling about in it has, as I
have shewn above, made the cloud hollow with a dense crust, it becomes
hot ·by its own velocity: thus you see all things thoroughly heated and
fired by motion; nay a leaden ball in whirling through a long course
even melts. When therefore this wind now on fire has rent the black
cloud, it scatters abroad at once seeds of fire pressed out by force so to
speak, and these produce the throbbing flashes of flame3 then follows a
sound which strikes on the ears more slowly than the things which
travel to our eyes strike on them. This you are to know takes place
when the clouds are dense and at the same time piled up on high one
above the other in marvellous accumulation 3 that you be not led into
error, because we see how great their breadth is below, rather than to
how great a height they are piled up. Observe, at a time when the
winds shall carry clouds like to mountains with a slanting course through
the air, or when you shall see them piled on the sides of great mountains
one on the top of the other and pressing down from above perfectly at
