esse aliam praeter plagas et pondera causam 28 5
motibus, unde haec est nobis innata potestaS,
de nilo quoniam fieri nil posse videmus,
pondus enim prohibet ne plagis omnia fiant
externa quasi vi; sed ne mens ipsa necessum
intestinum habeat cunctis in rebus agendis 290
et devicta quasi hoc cogatur ferre patique,
id facit exiguum clinamen principiorum
nec regione loci certa nec tempore certo,

Nec stipata magis suit umquam materiai
copia nec porro maioribus intervallis; 295
nam neque adaugescit quicquam neque deperit inde. -
quapropter quo nunc in motu principiorum
corpora sunt, in eodem ante acta aetate fuere
et post haec semper simili ratione ferentur,
et quae consuerint gigni gignentur eadem 300
condicione et erunt et crescent vique valebunt,
quantum cuique datum est per foedera naturai.
nec rerum summam commutare ulla potest vis3
nam neque, quo possit genus ullum materiai
effugere ex omni, quicquam est eoetra, neque in omne 305
unde coorta queat nova vis inrumpere et omnem
naturam rerum mutare et vertere motus

admit the same, admit that besides blows and weights there is another
cause of motions, from which this power of free action has been begotten
in us, since we see that nothing can come from nothing. For weight
forbids that all things be done by blows through as it were an outward
force ; But that the mind itself does not feel an internal necessity in all
its actions and is not as it were overmastered and compelled to bear and
put up with this, is caused by a minute swerving of first-beginnings at
no fixed part of space and no fixed time.

Nor was the store of matter ever more closely massed nor held apart
by larger spaces between 3 for nothing is either added to its bulk or lost
to it. Wherefore the bodies of the first—beginnings in time gone by
moved in the same way in which now they move, and will ever hereafter
be borne along in like manner, and the things which have been wont
to be begotten will be begotten after the same law and will be and will
grow and will wax in strength so far as is given to each by the decrees
of nature. And no force can change the sum of things for there is
nothing outside, either into which any kind of matter can escape out
of the universe or out of which a new supply can arise and burst into
the universe and change all the nature of things and alter their motions.
