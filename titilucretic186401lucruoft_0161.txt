hic Acherusia fit stultorum denique vita.

Hoc etiam tibi tute interdum dicere possis
‘lumina sis oculis etiam bonus Ancu’ reliquit 1025
qui melior multis quam tu fuit, improbe, rebus,
inde alii multi reges rerumque potentes
occiderunt, magnis qui gentibus imperitarunt.
ille quoque ipse, viam qui quondam per mare magnum
stravit iterque dedit legionibus ire per altum 1030
ac pedibus salsas docuit superare lucunas
et contemsit equis insultans murmura ponti,
lumine adempto animam moribundo corpore fudit.

erst paved 3 way over the great sea and made a path for his legions to
march over the deep and taught them to pass on foot over the salt pools
and set at naught the roarings of the sea, trampling on them with his
horses, had the light taken from him and shed forth his soul from his
dying body. The son of the Scipios, thunderbolt of war, terror of
Carthage, yielded his bones to earth just as if he were the lowest menial.
Think too of the inventors of all sciences and graceful arts, think of the
companions of the Heliconian maids3 among whom Homer bore the

sceptre without 3 peer, and he now sleeps the same sleep as others. Then
there is Democritus who, when a ripe old age had warned him that the
