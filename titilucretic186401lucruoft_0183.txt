quos tibi tum supra sol montis esse videtur

comminus ipse suo contingens fervidus igni,

vix absunt nobis missus bis mille sagittae,

vix etiam cursus quingentos saepe veruti:

inter eos solemque iacent immania ponti 410
aequora substrata aetheriis ingentibus oris,

interiectaque sunt terrarum milia multa

quae variae retinent gentes et saecla ferarum.

at conlectus aquae digitum non altior unum,

are between, held by diverse peoples and races of wild beastS. Then
a puddle of water not more than a finger-breadth deep, which stands
between the stones in the streets, offers a prospect beneath the earth
of a reach as vast, as that with which the high yawning mouth of
heaven opens out above the earth 3 80 that you seem to discern clouds
and see the sky and all the other objects far withdrawn into that
wondrous sky beneath the earth. Again when our stout horse has
stuck in the middle of a river and we have looked down on the swift
waters of the stream, some force seems to carry athwart the current the
body of the horse which is standing still and to force it rapidly up the
stream ; and to whatever point we cast our eyes about, all things seem

although a portico runs in parallel lines from one end to the other and
stands supported by equal columns along its whole extent, yet when
