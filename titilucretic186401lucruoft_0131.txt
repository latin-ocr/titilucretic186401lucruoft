sed communibus inter eas conflatur utrimque 335
motibus accensus nobis per viscera sensus.
praeterea corpus per se nec gignitur umquam
nec crescit neque post mortem durare videtur.
non enim, ut umor aquae dimittit saepe vaporem
qui datus est, neque ea causa convellitur* ipse, 340
sed manet incolumis, non, inquam, sic animai
,discidium possunt artus perferre relicti,
sed penitus pereunt convulsi conque putrescunt.
ex ineunte aevo sic corporis atque animai
mutua vitalis discunt contagia motus 345
maternis etiam membris alvoque reposta,
discidium ut nequeat fieri sine peste maloque3
ut videas, quoniam coniunctast causa salutis,
coniunctam quoque naturam consistere eorum.
Quod superest, siquis corpus sentire refutat 350
atque animam credit permixtam corpore toto
suscipere hunc motum quem sensum nominitamus
vel manifestas res contra verasque repugnat.
quid sit enim corpus sentire quis adferet umquam,
si non ipsa palam quod ‘res dedit ac docuit nos? 355
at dimissa anima corpus caret undique sensu3 345»

but sense is kindled throughout our flesh and blown into flame between
the two by the joint motions of these two natures. Moreover the body
by itself is never either begotten or grows or, it is plain, continues to
exist after death. For not in the way that the liquid of water often
loses the heat which has been given to it, yet is not for that reason itself
riven in pieces, but remains um‘mpaired,—not in this way, I say, can the
abandoned frame endure the separation of the soul, but riven in pieces
it utterly perishes and rots away. Thus the mutual connexions of body
and sou] from the first moment of their existence learn the vital motions
even while hid in the body and womb of the mother, so that no separa-
tion can take place without mischief and ruin. Thus you may see that,
since the cause of existence lies in their joint action, their nature too
must be a joint nature.

Furthermore if any one tries to disprove that the body feels and be-
lieves that the soul mixed through the whole body takes upon it this
motion which we name sense, he combats even manifest and undoubted
facts. For who will ever bring forward any explanation of what the
body’s feeling is, except that which the plain fact of the case has itself
given and taught to us? But when the soul it is said has departed, the
