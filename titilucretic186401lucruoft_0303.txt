inde ubi non potuit nubes capere inpetis auctum,
exprimitur vis atque ideo volat impete 111110,

nec facilest tali naturae opsistere quicquam3

inter enim fugit ac penetrat per rara viarum,

non igitur multis offensibus in remorando

haesitat, hanc ob rem celeri volat impete labens,

deinde, quod omnino natura pondera deorsum 335
omnia nituntur, cum plagast addita vero,

mobilitas duplicatur et impetus ille gravescit, s ’ἐ

denique quod longo venit impete, sumere debet 340
mobilitatem etiam atque etiam, quae crescit eundo

gathers itself up for a great effort at starting 3 then when the cloud is no
longer able to hold the increased moving power, their force is pressed
out and therefore it flies with a marvellous moving power, like to that
with which missiles are carried when discharged from powerful engines.
Then too it consists of small and smooth elements, and such a nature it
is not easy for anything to withstand3 for it flies between and passes in
through the porous passages 3 therefore it is not checked and delayed by
many collisions‚ and for this reason it glides and ffies on with a swift
moving power. Next, all weights without exception naturally pressing
downward, when moreover a blow is added, the velocity is doubled and
yon moving power becomes so intense that the nature of the thunderbolt
dashes aside more impetuously and swiftly whatever gets in its way and
tries to hinder it, and pursues its journey. Again as it advances with a
long-continued moving power, it must again and again receive new ve-
locity which ever increases as it goes 011 and augments its power-ful
might and gives vigour to its stroke, for it forces all the seeds of the
thunder to be borne right onward to one spot so to speak, throwing
them all together, as 011 they roll, into that single line. Perhaps too as
it goes on it attracts certain bodies out of the air to itself, and these by
their blows kindle apace its velocity. It passes too through things with-
