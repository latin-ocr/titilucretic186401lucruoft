mittat et hoc alicui nostrum sic increpet ipsa
‘ quid tibi tanto operest, mortaliS, quod nimis aegris
luctibus indulges? quid mortem congemis ac fles?
nam gratis anteacta fuit tibi vita priorque 935
et 11011 01111113 pertusum congesta quasi in vas
commoda perfluxere atque ingrata interiere:
cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis
aequo animoque capis securam, stulte, quietem?
sin ea quae fructus cumque es periere profusa 940
vitaque in offensust, cur amplius ad dere quaeriS,
rursum quod pereat male et ingratum occidat omne,
non potius vitae finem facis atque laboris?
nam tibi praeterea quod machiner inveniamque,
quod placeat,‘ nil est: eadem sunt omnia semper. 945
si tibi non 3111118 corpus iam marcet et artus
confecti languent, eadem tamen omnia restant,
omnia si pergas vivendo vincere saecla,
atque etiam potius, si numquam sis morituruS‚'
quid respondemUS, nisi iustam intendere litem 950
naturam et veram verbis exponere causam?
955 grandior hic vero si iam seniorque queratur
952 atque obitum lamentetur miser amplius aeqUO,

in person could rally any of us in such words as these, ‘what hast thou,
o mortal, so much at heart, that thou goest such lengths in sickly
sorrows‘l why bemoan and bewail death'l for if thy life past and gone
has been welcome to thee and thy blessings have not all, as if they were
poured into a perforated vessel, run through and been lost without avail 3
why not take thy departure like a guest filled with life, and with resig-
nation, thou f001‚ enter upon untroubled rest‘l but if all that thou hast
enjoyed, has been squandered and lost and life 1s a grievance, why seek
to make any addition, to be wasted perversely 111 its turn and lost utterly
without 3173112 why not rather make an end of life and travail} for
there' 1s nothing more which I can contrive and discover for thee to give
pleasure: all things are ever the same. Though thy body is not yet
decayed with years nor thy frame worn out and exhausted, yet 311 things
remain the same, ay and would remain, though 111 length of life thou
shouldst out-last all races of things now living, nay even more if thou
shouldst never die,' what answer do we make save this, that nature sets
up against us a well—founded claim and puts forth in her pleading a true
indictment'l If however one of greater age and more advanced in years
should complain and lament poor wretch his death more than is right,
