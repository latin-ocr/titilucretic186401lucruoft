aut rabidis canibus succinctas semimarinis 42‘522'120‘v

corporibus Scyllas et cetera de genere horum,

inter se quorum discordia membra videmus3

quae neque florescunt pariter nec robora sumunt 895
corporibus neque proiciunt aetate senecta

nec simili Venere ardescunt nec moribus unis
conveniunt, neque sunt eadem iucunda per artus.
quippe videre licet pinguescere saepe cicuta

barbigeras pecudeS, homini quae est acre venenum. 900
flamma quidem vero cum corpora fulva leonum

tam soleat torrere atque urere quam genus omne
visceris in terris quodcumque et sanguinis extet,

qui fieri potuit, triplici cum corpore ut una,

prima leo, postrema draco, media ipsa, Chimaera 905
ore foras acrem flaret de corpore flammam?

quare etiam tellure nova caeloque recenti

talia qui fingit potuisse animalia gigni,

nixus in hoc uno novitatis nomine inani,

multa licet simili ratione effutiat ore, 910
aurea tum dicat per terras flumina vulgo

fluxisse et gemmis florere arbusta sue‘sse

aut hominem tanto membrorum esse impete natum,
trans maria alta pedum nisus ut ponere posset

bodies half those of fishes girdled round with raving dogs can exist, and
all other things of the kind, whose limbs we see cannot harmonise toge-
ther 3 as they neither come to their flower at the same time nor reach the
fulness of their bodily strength nor lose it in advanced old age, nor burn
with similar passions nor have compatible manners, nor feel the same
things give pleasure throughout their frames. Thus we may see bearded
goats often fatten on hemlock which for man is rank poison. Since flame
moreover is wont to scorch and burn the tawny bodies of lions just as
much as any other kind of fiesh and blood existing on earth, how could
it be that a single chimera with triple body, in front a lion, behind a
dragon, in the middle the goat whose name it bears, could breathe out
at the mouth fierce flame from its body? Wherefore also he who sables
that in the new time of the earth and the fresh youth of heaven such
living creatures could have been begotten, resting upon this one futile
term new, may babble out many things in like fashion, may say that
rivers ran with gold over all parts of the earth, and that trees were wont
to blossom with precious stoneS, or that man was born with such giant
force of frame that he could wade on foot through deep seas and whirl
