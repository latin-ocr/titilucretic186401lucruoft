ignibus ac ventis cum primis ipse repletus, 260
in terra quoque ut horrescant ac tecta requirant.

sic igitur supera nostrum caput esse putandumst
tempestatem altam. neque enim caligine tanta

obruerent terraS, nisi inaedificata superne

multa forent multis exempto nubila sole ; 265
nec tanto possent venientes opprimere imbri,

flumina abundare ut facerent camposque natare,

si non extructis foret alte nubibus aether.

hic igitur ventis atque ignibus omnia plena

sunt3 ideo passim fremitus et fulgura fiunt. 270 ¹

quippe etenim supra docui permulta vaporis

semina habere cavas nubes et multa necessest

concipere ex solis radiis ardoreque eorum.

hoc ubi ventus eas idem qui cogit in unum

forte locum quemviS, expressit multa vaporis 2 7 5
semina seque simul cum eo commiscuit igni,

insinuatus ibi vortex versatur in arto

et calidis acuit fulmen fornacibus intus

nam duplici ratione accenditur, ipse sua cum

mobilitate calescit et e contagibus ignis, 280
inde ubi percaluit venti vis et gravis ignis

impetus incessit, maturum tum quasi fulmen

storms, itself so fraught above all the rest with fires and winds‚ that
even on land men shudder and seek shelter. Thus then we must suppose
that the storm above our head reaches high up 3 for the clouds would
never bury the earth in such thick darkness, unless they were built up
high heap upon heap, the sunlight totally disappearing3 nor could the
clouds when they descend drown it with so great a rain, as to make
rivers overfiow and put fields under water, if they were not piled high up
in the sky. In this case then all things are filled with winds and fire 3
therefore thunderings and lightnings go on all about. For I have shewn
above that hollow clouds have very many seeds of heat, and they must
also take many in from the sun's rays and their heat. On this account
when the same wind which happens to collect them into any one place,
has forced out many seeds of heat and has mixed itself up with that fire,
then the eddy of wind forces a way in and whirls about in the straitened
room and points the thunderbolt in the fiery furnaces within 3 for it is
kindled in two ways at once : it is heated by its own velocity and from
the contact of fire. After that when the force of the wind has been
thoroughly heated and the impetuous power of the fire has entered in,
then the thunderbolt fully forged as it were suddenly rends the cloud,
