nec porro vacuum. sunt ergo corpora certa

quae spatium pleno possint distinguere inane.

certain bodies to fill up whatever places they occupied, the existing
universe would be empty and void space. Therefore sure enough body
and void are marked off in alternate layers, since there exists neither
a perfect fulness nor a perfect void. There are therefore certain bodies
capable of marking off void space from full. These can neither be
broken in pieces by the stroke of blows from without nor have their
texture undone by aught piercing to their core nor give way before any
other kind of assault 3 as we have proved to you a little before. For
without void nothing seems to admit of being crushed in or broken up
or split in two by cutting, or of taking in wet or permeating cold or
penetrating fire, by which all things are destroyed. And the more
anything contains within it of void, the more thoroughly it gives way.
to the assault of these things. Therefore if first bodies are as I have
shewn solid and without void, they must be everlasting. Again unless
matter had been eternal, al] things before this would have utterly re-
turned to nothing and whatever things we see would have been born
anew from nothing. But since I have proved above that nothing can
be produced from nothing, and that what is begotten cannot be recalled
to nothing, firstssbeginnings must be of an imperishable body, into which
