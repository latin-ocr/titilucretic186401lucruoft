et miseram taetris se suffit odoribus ipsa 1175
quam famulae longe fugitant furtimque cachinnant.
at lacrimans exclusus amator limina saepe
floribus et sertis operit postisque superbos
unguit amaracino et foribus miser oscula figit;
quem si, iam ammissum, venientem offenderit aura 1180
una mod0‚ causas abeundi quaerat honesta-S,
et meditata diu cadat alte sumpta querella,
stultitiaeque ibi se damnet, tribuisse quod illi
plus videat quam mortali concedere par est.
nec Veneres nostras 1100 sallit3 quo magis ipsae 1185

gaudia sollicitat spatium decurrere amoris

and the long-conned deep—drawn complaint would fall to the ground3
and then he would blame his f011y‚ 011 seeing that he had attributed to
her more than it is right to concede to a mortal. Nor is this unknown
to our Venuses 3 wherefore all the more they themselves hide with the
utmost pains all that goes on behind the scenes of life from those* whom
they wish to retain in the chains of love 3 but in vain, since you may yet
, draw forth from her mind into the light all these things and search into
all her smiles 3 and if she is of a fair mind and not troublesome‚ overlook
them in your turn and make allowance for human failings.

Nor 'does the woman sigh always with fictitious love, when she locks
in her embracc and joins with her body the man's body and holds it,
suck'rng his lips into her lips and drinking in his kisses. Often she does
it from the heart, and secking mutual joys courts him to run the complete
