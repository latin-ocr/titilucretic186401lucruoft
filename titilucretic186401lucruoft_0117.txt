ΠΙ ’105

diffugiunt animi terroreS, moenia mundi

discedunt, totum video per inane geri res,

apparet divum numen sedesque quietae

quas neque concutiunt venti nec nubila nimbis

aspergunt neque nix acri concreta pruina 20

cana cadens violat semperque innubilus aether

integit, et large diffuso lumine rident.

omnia suppeditat porro natura neque ulla

res animi pacem delibat tempore in ullo,

at contra nusquam apparent Acherusia templa 25

nec tellus obstat quin omnia dispiciantur,

with hoary fall: an ever cloudless ether o'ercanopies them, and they
laugh with light shed largely round. Nature too supplies all their wants
and nothing ever impairs their peace of mind. But on the other hand
the Acherusian quarters are nowhere to be seen, though earth is no bar
to all things being desmied, which are in operation underneath our
feet throughout the void. At all this a kind of godlike delight mixed
with shuddering awe comes over me to think that nature by thy power
is laid thus visibly open, is thus unveiled on every side.

And now since I have shewn what-like the beginnings of all things
are and how diverse with varied shapes as they fly spontaneously driven
on in everlasting motion, and how all things can be severally produced
out of these, next after these questions the nature of the mind and soul
should methinks be cleared up by my verses and that dread of Acheron
be driven headlong forth, troubling as it does the life of man from its
