quae supera caput aetheriis cernuntur in oris 85

rursus in antiquas referuntur religiones

et dominos acris adsciscunt, omnia posse

quos miseri credunt, ignari quid queat esse,

quid nequeat, finita potestas denique cuique

quanam sit ratione atque alte terminus haerens, 90
Quod superest, ne te in promissis plura moremur,

principio maria ac terras caelumque tuere3

quorum naturam triplicem, tria corpora, Memmi,

tris species tam dissimilis, tria talia texta,

una dies dabit exiti0‚ multosque per annos 95

‘ sustentata ruet moles et machina mundi.

nec me animi fallit quam res nova miraque menti

accidat exitium caeli terraeque futurum,

et quam difficile id mihi sit pervincere dictis3

ut fit ubi insolitam rem adportes auribus ante 100

nec tamen hanc possis oculorum subdere visu

nec iacere indu manus via qua munita fidei

proxima fert humanum in pectus templaque mentis,

sed tamen effabor. dictis dabit ipsa fidem res

forsitan et graviter terrarum motibus ortis 105

ethereal bor-ders, are borne back again into their old religious scruples and
take unto themselves hard taskmasters, whom they poor wretches believe
to be almighty‚ not knowing what can, what cannot be, in short by what
system each thing has its powers defined, its deep-set boundary mark.

Well then not to detain you any longer by mere promiseS, look be—
fore all on seas and lands and heaven: their threefold nature, their three
bodies, Memmius, three forms so unlike‚ three such wondrous textures a
single day shall give over to destruction 3 and the mass and fabric of the
world upheld for many years shall tumble. to ruin. Nor can I fail to
perceive with what a novel and strange effect it falls upon the mind,
this destruction of heaven and earth that is to be, and how hard it is
sor me to produce a full conviction of it by words; as is the case when
you bring to the ears a thing hitherto unexampled, and yet you cannot
submit it to the eyesight nor put it into the hands 3 through which the
ἱ straightest highway of belief leads into the human breast ancl quarters
of the mind. But· yet I will speak out: it well may be that the reality
itself will bring credit to my words and that you will see earthquakes
arise and all things grievously shattered to pieces in a short time. But
this may pilot fortune gulde far away from uS‚ and may reason rather
