V 243

ut faciunt, lunam qui fingunt esse pilai

consimilem cursusque viam sub sole tenere.

est etiam quare proprio cum lumine possit 715
volvier et varias splendoris reddere formas

corpus enim licet esse aliud quod fertur et una

labitur omnimodis occursans officiensque

nec potis est cerni, quia cassum lumine fertur.
versarique potest, globus ut, si forte, pilai 720
dimidia ex parti candenti 'lumine tinctUS,

versandoque globum variantis edere formaS‚

donique eam partem, quaecumque est ignibus aucta,

ad speciem vertit nobis oculosque patentis3

inde minutatim retro contorquet et aufert 725
luciferam partem glomeraminis atque pilai;

ut Babylonica Chaldaeum doctrina refutans

astrologorum artem contra convincere tendit,

proinde quasi id fieri nequeat quod pugnat uterque

aut minus hoc illo sit cur amplectier ausis, 730
denique cur nequeat semper nova luna creari

ordine formarum certo certisque figuris

inque dies privos aborisci quaeque creata

atque alia illius reparari in parte locoque,

difficilest ratione docere et vincere verbiS, 735

the signs 3 according to the theory of those who suppose the moon to be
like a 11311 and to hold on her course under the sun. She may also very
possibly revolve with her own light and display various phases of bright-
ness 3 for there may well be another body which is carried on and
glides in her company getting before her path and obstructing her in all
manner of ways and yet cannot be seen, because it glides on without
light. She may also revolve, like it may be to a spherical ball steeped
over one half in shining light, and as she rolls round this sphere she
may present changing phases, until she has turned that half which is
illuminated full towards our sight and open eyes 3 then by slow steps she
whirls back and withdraws the light-fraught half of the spherical ball 3
as the Babylonian science of the Chaldees refuting the system of the
astronomers essays to prove in opposition to them 3 just as though that
which each party fights for might not be equally true, or there were any
reason why you should venture to embrace the one theory less than the
other. Again, why a new moon should not be born every day after
a regular succession of forms and regular phases, and each day the one
which is born perish and another be produced in its room and stead, it
is not easy to teach by reasoning or prove by words, since wo, many
