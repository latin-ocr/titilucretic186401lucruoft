Perfacile est tali ratione exsolvere nobis

quare fulmineus multo penetralior ignis

quam noster fuat e taedis terrestribus ortus3

dicere enim possis caelestem fulminis ignem

suptilem magis e parvis constare figuris 385

atque ideo transire foramina quae nequit ignis

where the sea with gentle waves beats on the thirsty sand of the wind-
ing shore. Therefore again and again I say it is necessary for like
reasons that first-beginnings of things, since they exist by nature and
are not made by hand after the exact model of one, should fly about
with shapes in some cases differing one from the other.

It is right easy for us on such a principle to explain why the fire
of lightning has much more power to pierce than ours which is born
of earthly pinewood: you may say that the heavenly fire of lightning
subtle as it is is formed of smaller shapes and therefore passes through
openings which this our fire cannot pass born as it is of woods and
sprtmg from pine. Again light passes through horn, but rain is thrown
off. Whyz if not that those first bodies of light are smaller than those
of which the nurturing liquid of water is made, And quickly as we
see wines fiow through a strainer, sluggish oil on the other hand is slow
to do so, because sure enough it consists of elements either larger in
size or more hooked and tangled in one another, and therefore it is that
the first-beginnings of things cannot so readily be separated from each
other and severally stream through the several openings of any thing.

Moreover the liquids honey and milk excite a pleasant sensation of
