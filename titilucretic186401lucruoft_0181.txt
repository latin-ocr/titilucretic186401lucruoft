fit quasi ut ad tornum saxorum structa terantur3
non tamen ut coram quae sunt vereque rutunda,
sed quasi adumbratim paulum simulata videntur.
umbra videtur item nobis in sole moveri
et vestigia nostra sequi gestumque imitari; 36 5
aera si credis privatum lumine posse
indugredi, motus hominum gestumque sequentem3
nam nil esse potest aliut nisi lumine cassus

nimirum quia terra locis ex ordine certis 370
lumine privatur solis quacumque meantes

semper enim nova se radiorum lumina fundunt 375
primaque dispereunt, quasi in ignem lana trahatur.
propterea facile et spoliatur lumine terra

stone structures are rounded off as if by the lathe 3 yet they do not look
like the things which are close before us and really round, but somewhat

move in the sunshine and to follow our steps and mimic our action 3 if
you think forsooth that air deprived of light can step, imitating the
motions and the action of men3 for that which we are wont to term
shadow can be nothing but air devoid of light. Sure enough because
the earth in certain spots successively is deprived of light wherever we
intercept it in moving about, while that part of it which we have
quitted is filled with light, therefore that which was the shadow of our
body, seems to have always followed us unchanged in a direct line with
us. For new rays of light ever pour in and the old are lost, just as if
wool were drawn into the fire. Therefore the earth is readily stripped
of light, and again filled, and cleanses itself from black shadows.

And yet in all this we do not admit that the eyes are cheated one
whit. For it is their province to observe in what spot soever light and
shade are 3 but whether the lights are still the same or not, and whether
it is the same shadow which was in this spot that is now passing to
that, or whether what we said a little before, is not rather the fact, this
