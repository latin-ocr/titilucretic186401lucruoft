non quo multa parum simili sint praedita forma,

to stand still and to rest on the plains as a bright spot.

widely differing in their forms are the beginnings of all things, how
varied by manifold diversities of shape 3 not that a scanty number are
possessed of 3 similar form, but because ‘they 313 not 311 without ex-

a store of them that, 38 Ι have shewn, there is no end or sum, they
must sure enough not be all marked by a preeisely equal bulk and like
shape, one with another. The race of man vouches the fact and the ⁶
mute swimming shoals of the scaly tribes and the blithe herds and wild ,
beasts and the different birds which haunt the gladdening watering spots

about river-banks and springs and pools, and those which flit about ⁴

and throng the pathless woods: go and take any one you like in any
one kind, and you will yet find that they differ in shapes, every one
from every other. And in no other way could child recognise mother
