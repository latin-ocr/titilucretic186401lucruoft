ut pluere in multis regionibus et cadere imbriS, 415
fulmina sic uno fieri sub tempore multa.
postremo cur sancta deum delubra suasque
discutit infesto praeclaras fulmine sedes ”
et bene facta deum frangit simula-cra suisque
demit imaginibus violento volnere honorem? 420
altaque cur plerumque petit loca plurimaque eius
montibus in summis vestigia cernimus ignis?

Quod superest, facilest ex his cognoscere rebUS,
prestera-s Grai quos ab re nominitarunt,

in -mare qua missi veniant ratione superne. 425 W„-

nam fit ut interdum tamquam demissa columna

in mare de caelo descendat, quam freta circum
fervescunt graviter spirantibus incita flabriS‚

et quaecumque in eo turn sint deprensa tumultu
navigia in summum veniant vexata periclum. 430
hoc fit ubi interdurn non quit vis incita venti

rumpere quam coepit nubem, sed deprimit, ut sit

in mare de caelo tamquam demissa columna,

wrought idols of the gods, and spoil his own images of their glory by
an overbearing woundZ and why does he mostly aim at lofty spots, and
why do we see most traces of his fire on the mountain tops‘l

To proceed, it is easy from these facts to understand in what way
those things& which the Greeks from their nature have named presteres,
come down from above into the sea. For sometimes a pillar so to speak
is let down from heaven and descends into the sea, and round about it
the surges boil, roused by heavy blasts of winds 3 and all ships caught in
that turmoil are dashed about and brought into extreme danger. This
takes place when at times the force of the wind aroused cannot burst
the cloud which it essays to burst, but weighs it down, so that it is like
a pillar let down from heaven into the sea, but gradually, just as if a
thing were thrust down from above and stretched out to the level of
the waters by the fist and push of the arm 3 and when the force of the

wind has rent this cloud, it bursts out from it into the sea and occasions
