fire it has 3 just as it often parts with the frost which it holds in itself,
and thaws the ice and loosens its bonds.

There is also a cold fountain of such a nature that tow often when
held over it imbibes fire forthwith and emits flame 3 a pine torch too is
lighted and shines among the waters, in whatever direction it swims

under the impulse of the winds. Because sure enough there are 10 the
water very many seeds of heat, and from the earth itself at the bottom

must rise up bodies of fire throughout the whole fountain and at the
same time pass abroad in exhalations and go forth into the air, not in
such numbers however that the fountain can become hot, for these rea-
sons a force compels those seeds to burst out through the water and
disperse abroad and to unite when they have mounted up. In the sea
at Aradus is a fountain of this kind, which wells up with fresh water
and keeps off the salt waters all round it3 and in many other quarters
the sea affords a seasonable help in need to thirsting sailors, vomiting
forth fresh waters-amid the salt. In this way then those seeds may
burst forth through that fountain and well out into the tow. And when
they meet together in it or cohere in the body of the pine-torch, they at
once readily take fire, because the tow and pinewood contain in them
likewise many seeds of latent fire. See you not too that, when you bring
