discutiant, sed naturae species ratioque.

Nunc age, quo motu genitalia materiai
corpora res varias gignant genitasque resolvant
et qua vi facere id cogantur quaeque sit ollis
reddita mobilitas magnum per inane meandi, 65
expediam: tu te dictis praebere memento.
nam certe non inter se stipata cohaeret
materies quoniam minui rem quamque videmus
et quasi longinquo fluere omnia cernimus aevo
ex oculisque vetustatem subducere nostriS, 70
cum tamen incolumis videatur summa manere
propterea quia, quae decedunt corpora cuique,
unde abeunt minuunt, quo venere augmine donant,
illa senescere at haec contra florescere cogunt,
nec remorantur ibi. sic rerum summa novatur 75
semper, et inter se mortales mutua vivunt.
augescunt aliae gentes aliae minuuntur,
inque brevi spatio mutantur saecla animantum
et quasi cursores vitai lampada tradunt.

Si cessare putas rerum primordia posse 80
cessandoque novos rerum progignere motus
avius a vera longe ratione vagaris,

the aspect and law of nature.

Now mark and I will explain by what motion the begetting bodies
of matter do beget different things and after they are begotten again
break them up, and by what force they are compellet] so to do and what
velocity is given to them for travelling through the great void: do you
mind to give heed to my words. For verily matter does not cohere
inseparably massed together, since we see that everything wanes and
perceive that all things ebb as it were by length of time and that age
withdraws them from our sight, though yet the sum is seen to remain
unimpaired by reason that the bodies which quit each thing, lessen the
things from which they g0‚ gift with increase those to which they have
come, compel the former to grow old, the latter to come to their prime,
and yet abide not with these. Thus the sum of things is ever renewed
and mortals live by a reciprocal dependency. Some nations wax, others
wane, ancl in a brief space the races of living things are changed and
like runners hand over the lamp of life.

If you think that first-beginnings of things can stop and by stopping
propagate new motions of things, you wander far astray from the path
