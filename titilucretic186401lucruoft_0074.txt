ex supero graviora neque ictus gignere per se

qui varient motus per quos natura gerat reS.

quare etiam atque etiam paulum inclinare necessest

corpora3 nec plus quam minimum, ne fingere motus

obliquos videamur et id res vera refutet. 245

namque hoc in promptu manifestumque esse videmus

pondera, quantum in sest, non posse obliqua meare,

ex supero cum praecipitant, quod cernere possis3

sed nil omnino recta regione viai

declinare quis est qui possit cernere sese? 250
Denique si semper motus conectitur omnis

et vetere exoritur semper novus ordine certo

nec declinando faciunt primordia motus

principium quoddam quod fati foedera rumpat,

ex infinito ne causam causa sequatur, 255

libera per terras unde haec animantibus exstat,

unde est haec, inquam, fatis avolsa potestas

per quam progredimur quo ducit quemque voluntaS,

declinamus item motus nec tempore certo ⁴

nec regione loci certa, sed ubi ipsa tulit mens? 260

nam dubio procul his rebus sua xcuique voluntas

principium dat et hinc motus per membra rigantur.

from above on lighter nor of themselves to beget blows sufficient to pro-
duce the varied motions by which nature carries on things. Wherefore
again and again I say bodies must swerve a little 3 and yet not more
than the least possible 3 lest we be found to be imagining oblique mo-
tions and this the reality should refute. For this we see to be plain
and evident, that weights, so far as in them is, cannot trave] obliquely,
when they fall from above, at least so far as you can perceive 3 but
that nothing can swerve in any case from the straight course, who is
there that can perceive?

Again if all motion is ever linked together and a new motion ever
springs from another in a fixed order and first-beginnings do not by
swerving make some commencement of motion to break through the
decrees of fate, that cause follow not cause from everlasting‚ whence
have all living creatures here on earth, whence, I ask, has been wrested
from the fates the power by which we go forward whither the will leads
each, by which likewise we change the direction of o'ur motions neither
at a fixed time nor fixed place, but where and when the mind itself has
prompted? For beyond a doubt in these things his own will makes for
each a beginning and from this beginning motions are welled through
