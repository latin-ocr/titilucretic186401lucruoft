turicremas propter mactatus concidit aras

sanguinis expirans calidum de pectore flumen ;

at mater viridis saltus orbata peragrans 35 5
noscit humi pedibus vestigia pressa bisulciS,

omnia convisens oculis loca si queat usquam

conspicere amissum fetum, completque querellis
frondiferum nemus absistens et crebra revisit

ad stabulum desiderio perfixa iuvenci, 360
nec tenerae salices atque herbae rore vigentes
fluminaque illa queunt summis labentia ripis

oblectare animum sumptamque avertere curam,

blood3 but the bereaved mother as she ranges over the green lawns knows
the footprints stamped on the ground by the cloven hoofs‚ scanning
with her eyes every spot to see if she can anywhere behold her lost
youngling: then she fills with her moanings the leafy wood as she desists
from her search and again and again goes back to the stall pierced to
the heart by the loss os her calf3 nor can the soft willows and grass
quickened with dew and those rivers· gliding -level with their banks
comfort her mind and put away the care that is on her, nor can other
forms of calves throughout the glad pastui-es diver} >her mind and ease
it of its care: so persistently she seeks something special and known.
Again the tender kids with their shaking voices know their horned
dams and the butting lambs the fiocks of bleating sheep: thus they run,
as nature craves, each without fail to its own udder of milk. Lastly
in the case of any kind of corn you like you will yet find that any one
grain is not so similar to any other in the same kind, but that there
runs through them some difference to distinguish the forms. On a like
principle of difference we see the class of shells paint the lap of earth,
