sed minimum quodvis nequeat consistere tempus?

nec sibi enim quisquam moriens sentire videtur

ire foras animam incolumem de corpore toto

nec prius ad iugulum et supera succedere fauceS,

verum deficere in certa regione locata1n3 610
ut sensus alios in parti quemque sua scit

dissolui. quod si inmortalis nostra foret mens,

non tam se moriens dissolvi conquereretur,

sed magis ire foras vestemque relinquere, ut anguis.

Denique cur animi numquam mens consiliumque 615

gignitur in capite aut pedibus manibusve, sed unis
sedibus et certis hominis regionibus haeret,

si non certa loca ad nascendum reddita cuique

sunt, et ubi quicquid possit durare creatum,

atque ita multimodis partitis artubus esse, 620
membrorum ut numquam existat praeposterus ordo?
, usque adeo sequitur res rem neque flamma creari
fluminibus solitast neque in igni gignier algor.

Praeterea si inmortalis natura animaist

et sentire potest secreta a corpore nostro, 625

nec ratione alia nosmet proponere nobis

possumus infernas animas Acherunte vagari.

through eternity, but is unable to hold together the smallest fraction of
time? No one when dying appears to feel the soul go forth entire from
his whole body or first mount up to the throat and gullet, but all feel it
fail in that part which lies in a particular quarter3 just as they know
that other senses suffer dissolution each in its own place. But if our
mind were immortaL it would not when dying complain so much of its
dissolution, as of passing abroad and quitting its vestm-e, like a snake.

Again why are the mind’s understanding and judgment never be-
gotten in the head or feet or hands, but cling to one spot and fixed
quarter of the man, if it be not that particular places are assigned for
the birth of each part, and for the abode of each after it is born, that
thus the members may be distributed with such a manifold organisation
of parte, that no perverted arrangement of them shall ever show itself 2
so invariably effect follows cause, nor is flame wont to be born in rivers
nor cold in fire. ·

Again if the nature of the soul is immortal and can feel when
separated from our body, methinks we must suppose it to be provided
with five sensesj, and in no other way can we picture to oui-selvas souls
below flitting about Acheron. Painters therefore and former genera-
