DE RERUM NATURA

LIBER. PRIMUS

Aeneadum genetrix, hominum divomque volupta3‚
alma VenUS, caeli subter labentia signa

quae mare navigerum, quae terras frugiferentis
concelebraS, per te quoniam genus omne animantum

concipitur visitque exortum lumina solis 5
te, dea, te fugiunt venti, te nubila caeli

adventumque tuum, tibi suavis daedala tellus

summittit floreS, tibi rident aequora ponti

placatumque nitet diffuso lumine caelum.

nam simul ac species patefactast verna diei 10
et reserata viget genitabilis aura favoni,

aeriae primum volucres te, diva, tuumque

significant initum perculsae corda tua vi.
15 inde ferae pecudes persultant pabula laeta
14 et rapidos tranant amnis: ita capta lepore 15

Mother of the Aeneadae, darling of men and goda increase-giving
Venus, who beneath the gliding signs of heaven fillest with thy presence
the ship-carrying sea, the corn-bearing lands, since through thee every
kind of living things is conceived, rises up and beholds the light of the
sun. Before thee, goddess, fiee the winds, the clouds of heaven3 before
thee and thy advent 3 for thee earth mam'fold in works puts forth sweet-
smelling flowers 3 for thee the levels of the sea do laugh and heaven pro-
s pitiated shines with outspread light. For soon as the vernal aspect of
3 day is disclosed, and the birth-favouring breath of favonius unbarred is-
blowing fresh, first the fowls of the air, o lady, shew signs of thee and
thy entering in, throughly smitten in heart by thy power. N ext the
wild herds bound over the glad pastures and swim the rapid rivers z in
such wise each made prisoner by thy charm follows thee with desire,
