Know you not by sight or hearsay how they commonly perish in a short
time and how all vital power fails those whom the hard compulsion of
necessity confines in such an employmentCl All such cxhalations then
the earth steams forth and breathes out into the open air and light of
heaven.

Thus too the Avernian spots must send up some power deadly to
birds, which rises up from the earth into the air so as to poison a certain
portion of the atmosphere 3 in such a way that as soon as ever a bird is
borne on his wings into it, it is then attacked by the unseen poison and
so palsied that it tumbles plump down on the spot where this exhalation
has its course. And when it falls into it, then the same power of that
exhalation robs all its limbs of the remnants of life: first of all it causes
a sort of dizziness 3 but afterwards, when the birds have tumbled into the
very springs of the poison, then life too has to be vomited forth, because
all round rises up large store of mischievous matter.

Sometimes too this power and exhalation of Avernus dispels what-
ever air lies between the birds and earth, so that almost a void. is left
there. And when the birds have arrived in their flight just opposite
