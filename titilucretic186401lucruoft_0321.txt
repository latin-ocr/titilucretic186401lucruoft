cum mare permotum ventis ruit intus harenam3
quo fit uti pacto liber minus exitus amni
et proclivis item fiat minus impetus undis.
fit quoque uti pluviae forsan magis ad caput ei
tempore eo fiant, quod etesia fiabra aquilonum 730
nubila coniciunt in eas tunc omnia partis,
scilicet ad mediam regionem eiecta diei
cum convenerunt, ibi ad altos denique montis
contrusae nubes coguntur vique premuntur.
forsitan Aethiopum penitus de montibus altis 735
crescat, ubi in campos albas descendere ningues
tabificis subigit radiis sol omnia lustrans,
Nunc age, Averna tibi quae sint loca cumque lacusque
expediam, quali natura praedita constent.

It may be also that the rains are more frequent at its source in that
season, because the etesian blasts of the north winds drive all the clouds

they have been driven on to the central region of day and have gathered
together, then the clouds jammed close against the high mountains are
massed together and violently compressed. Perhaps too it gets its in-
crease high up from the lofty mountains of the Ethiopians, when the all-
surveying sun with his thawing rays constrains the white snows to
descend into the plains.

Now mark, and I will make clear to you what kind of nature the
several Avernian places and lakes possess, First of all, as to the name
Avernian by which they are called, it has been given to them from their
real nature, because they are noxious to all birds ,- for when they have,

arrived in fiight just opposite those spots, they forget to row with their fi ’-

wings, they drop their sails and fall with soft neck outstretched headlong
to the earth, if so be that the nature of the ground admit of that, or
into the water, if so be that a lake of Avernus spreads below. There
