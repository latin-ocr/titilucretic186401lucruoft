tecta solo iungens atque omnia dextera laevis 430

in pelago nautis ex undis ortus in undis

sol fit uti videatur obire et condere lumen;

quippe ubi nil aliud nisi aquam caelumque tuentur3

ne leviter credas labefactari undique sensus, 435
at maris ignaris in portu clauda videntur

lightly suppose the credit of the senses to be shaken on all hands. Then
to people unacquainted with the sea ships in harbour seem to be all
askew and with poop- -fittings broken to be pressing up against the water.
For whatever part of the oars is raised above the salt water, is straight,
and the rudders in their upper half are straight: the parts which are
sunk below the water-level, appear to be broken and bent round and to
slope up and turn back towards the surface and to be so much twisted
back as wellnigh to float on the top of the water. And when the winds
carry the thjnly scattered clouds across heaven in the night-time, then
do the glittering signs appear to glide athwart the rack and to be
travelling on high in a direction quite different to their real course.
Then if our hand chance to be placed beneath one eye and press it
below, through a certain sensation all things which we look at appear
