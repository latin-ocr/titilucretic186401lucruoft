haec eadem3 neque enim, mortali corpore quae sunt,
ex infinito iam tempore adhuc potuissent
inmensi validas aevi contemnere vires,
Denique tantopere inter se cum maxima mundi 380
pugnent membra, pio nequaquam concita 106110,-
11011116 vides aliquam longi certaminis ollis
posse dari finem? vel cum sol et vapor omnis
omnibus epotis umoribus exsuperarint:
quod facere intendunt, neque adhuc conata patrantur: 385
tantum suppeditant amnes ultraque minantur
omnia diluviare ex alto gurgite ponti,
nequiquam, quoniam verrentes aequora venti
deminuunt radiisque retexens aetherius sol,
et siccare prius confidunt omnia posse 390
quarn liquor incepti possit contingere finem.
tantum spirantes aequo certamine bellurn
magnis inter se de rebus cernere certant,
cum semel interea fuerit superantior ignis
et semel, ut fama est, umor regnarit in arvis, 395
ignis enirn superat et lambens multa perussit,
avia cum Phaethonta rapax vis solis equorum
aethere raptavit toto terrasque per omnis,

an infinite time back up to the present have been able to set at nought
the puissant strength of immeasurable age.

Again since the chiefest members of the world fight so hotly together,
fiercely stirred by no hallowed civil warfare, see you not that some limit
may be set to their long struggle? either when the sun and all heat
shall have drunk up all the waters and gotten the mastery: this they
are ever striving to do, but as yet are unable to accomplish their
endeavours: such abundant supplies the rivers furnish, and threaten to
turn aggressors and flood all things with a deluge from the deep gulph
of ocean 3 all in vain, since the winds sweeping over the seas and the
ethereal sun decomposing them with his rays lessen them, and trust to
be able to dry all things up before water can attain the end of its endea-
vour. Such a war do they breathe out with undecided issue, and strive
with each other to determine it for mighty ends 3 though once by the„
way fire got the upper hand and once, as the story goes, water reigned
dominant 111 the fields. Fire gained the mastery and licked and burnt
up many things, when the headstrong might of the horses of the sun
dashed from the course and hurried Phaethon through the whole sky
