corpora perpetuo volitare invicta per aevom,
nunc age, summai quaedam sit finis eorum
necne sit, evolvamus; item quod inane repertumst
seu locus ac spatium, res in quo quaeque gerantur, 95 5
pervideamus utrum finitum funditus omne -
constet an immensum pateat vasteque profundum.
Omne quod est igitur nulla regione viarum
finitumst3 namque extremum debebat habere.
extremum porro nullius posse videtur 960
esse, nisi ultra sit quod finiat 3 ,ut videatur
quo non longius haec sensus natura sequatur.
nunc extra summam quoniam nil esse fatendum,
non habet extremum, caret ergo fine modoque.
nec refert quibus adsistas regionibus eius3 965
usque ade0, quem quisque locum possedit, in omnis
tantundem partis infinitum omne relinquit.
praeterea si iam finitum constituatur
omne quod est spatium, siquis procurrat ad oras
ultimus extremas iaciatque volatile telum, 970
id validis utrum contortum viribus ire
quo fuerit missum mavis longeque volare,
an prohibere aliquid censes obstareque posse?

for ever unvanquished through all time, mark now, let us unfold
whether there is or is not any limit to their sum 3 likewise let us clearly
see whether that which has been found to be void, or room and space, in
which things severally go on, is all of it altogether finite or stretches

without limits and to an unfathomable depth. s ‘5' ⁷ *s ³-

Well then the existing universe is bounded in none of its (11111811-Γ
sions3 for then it must have had an outside. Again it is seen that
there can be an outside of nothing, unless there be something beyond it
to bound it, so that that is seen, farther than which this our nature of
sense does not follow the thing. Now since we must admit that there
is nothing outside the sum, it has no outside‚ and therefore is without
end and limit. And it matters not in which of its regions you take
your stand 3 so invariably, whatever position any one has taken up, he
leaves the universe just as infinite as before in all directions. Again if
for the moment all existing space be held to be bounded, supposing a
man runs forward to its outside borders and stands on the utmost verge
and then throws a winged javelin, do you choose that it when hurled
with vigorous force shall advance to the point to which it has been sent
and fly to a distance, or do you decide that something can get in its way
