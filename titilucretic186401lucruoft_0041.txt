I 29

clarus ob obscuram linguam magis inter inanis
quamde gravis inter Graios qui vera requirunt. 640
omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque,
inversis quae sub verbis latitantia cernunt,
veraque constituunt quae belle tangere possunt
auris et lepido quae sunt fucata sonore.
Nam cur tam variae res possint esse requiro, 645
· ex uno si sunt igni puroque creatae3
nil prodesset enim calidum denserier ignem
nec rarefieri, si partes ignis eandem
naturam quam totus habet super ignis haberent.
acrior ardor enim conductis partibus esset, 650
languidior porro disiectis disque supatis:
amplius hoc fieri nil est quod posse rearis
talibus in causis, nedum variantia rerum
tanta queat densis rarisque ex ignibus esse.
id quoque, si· faciant admixtum rebus inane, 655
denseri poterunt ignes rarique relinqui.
sed quia multa sibi cernunt contraria nasci
et fugitant in rebus inane relinquere purum,
ardua dum metuunt, amittunt vera viai,
nec rursum cernunt exempto rebus inani 660

omnia denseri fierique ex omnibus unum

to do battle, famous for obscurity more among the frivolous than the
earnest Greeks who seek the truth. For fools admire and like all things
the more which they perceive to be concealed under involved⁴ language,
and determine things to be true which can prettily tickle the ears and
are varnished over with finely sounding phrase.

For Iwant to know how things can be so various, if they are formed
out of fire one and unmixed: it would avail nothing for hot fire to
be condensed or rarefied, if the parts of fire had always the same nature
which the whole fire likewise has. The heat would be more intense by
compression of parts, more faint by their severance and dispersion.
More than this you cannot think it in the power of such causes to effect,
far less could so great a diversity of things come from mere density and
rarity of fires. Observe also, if they suppose void to be mixed up in
things, fire may then be condensed and left rare 3 but because they sce
many things rise up in contradiction to them and shrink from leaving
'unmixed void in things, fearing the steep, they lose the true road, and
do not perceive on the other hand that if void is taken from things, all
things are condensed and out of all things is formed one single body,
