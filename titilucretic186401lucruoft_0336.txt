pervolet intactUS, nequeunt inpellier usquam; 1060
lignea materies in quo genere esse videtur.
interutraque igitur ferri natura locata
aeris ubi accepit quaedam corpuscula, tum fit,
inpellant ut eam Magnesia flumine saxa.
N ec tamen haec ita sunt aliarum rerum aliena, 1065
ut mihi multa parum genere ex hoc suppeditentur
quae memorare queam inter se singlariter apta.
saxa vides primum sola colescere calce.
glutine materies taurino iungitur uno,

And yet these cases are not so much at variance with other things,
that I have only a scanty store of similar instances to relate of things
mutually fitted one for the other and for nothing else: stones for instance
you see are cemented by mortar alone 3 wood is united with wood so
firmly by bulls’ glue only, that the veins of boards often gape in cracks
before the binding power of the glue can be brought to loosen its hold.
Vine-born juices venture to mix with streams of water, though heavy
pitch and light oil cannot. Again the purple dye of the shellfish so
unites with the body of wool alone, that it cannot in any case be severed,
not were you to take pains to undo what is done with Ncptune's wave,
not if the whole sea were willed to wash it out with all its waters. Then
too is there not one thing only that fastens gold to gold, and is not brass
soldered to brass by tin2 and how many other cases of the kind might
one find! what then? you have no need whatever of such long cir-
