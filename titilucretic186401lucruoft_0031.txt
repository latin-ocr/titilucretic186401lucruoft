I 19

talibus in rebus poteris caecasque latebras

insinuare omnis et verum protrahere inde.

quod si pigraris paulumve recesseris ab re, 410
hoc tibi de plano possum promittere, Memmi:

usque adeo largos haustus e fontibu' magnis

lingua meo suavis diti de pectore fundet,

ut verear ne tarda prius per membra senectus

serpat et in nobis vitai claustra resolvat, 415
quam tibi de quavis una re versibus omnis

argumentorum sit copia missa per auris.
Sed nunc ut repetam coeptum pertexere dictis,

omnis ut est igitur per se natura duabus

constitit in rebus; nam corpora sunt et inane, 420
haec in quo sita sunt et qua diversa moventur.

corpus enim per se communis dedicat esse

sensus3 cui nisi prima fides fundata valebit,

haut erit occultis de rebus quo referentes

confirmare animi quicquam ratione queamus, 425
tum porro locus ac spatium, quod inane vocamuS,

si nullum foret, haut usquam sita corpora possent

esse neque omnino quoquam diversa meare3

id quod iam supera tibi paulo ostendimus ante.
praeterea nil est quod possis dicere ab omni ⁴ 430
corpore seiunctum secretumque esse ab inani,

aster another and find your way into all dark corners and draw forth
the truth. But if you lag or swerve a jot from the reality, this I can
promise you, 0 Memmius, at once without more ado: such plenteous
draughts from abundant wellsprings my sweet tongue shall pour from
my -richly furnished breast, that I fear slow age will steal over our limbs
and break open in us the fastnesses of life, ere the whole store of reasons
on any one question has by my verses been dropped into your ears.

But now to resume the thread of the design which I am weaving 111
verse: all nature then, as it exists by itself, has been founded on two
things: there are bodies and there is void in which these bodies are
placed and through which they move about. For that body exists by
itself the general feeling of mankind declares ; and unless the first foun-
dation of belief shall be firmly grounded on this, there will be nothing
to which we can appeal in order to prove anything by reasoning of mind.
Then again, if room and space which we call void did not exist, bodies
could not be placed anywhere nor move about at all ς as we have
demonstrated to you a little before. Moreover there is nothing which
you can affirm to be at once separate from all body and quite distinct
