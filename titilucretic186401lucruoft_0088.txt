ut videantur et indicium mortalibus edant,
infidi maris insidias virisque dolumque
’ ut vitare velint, neve ullo tempore credant,
subdola cum ridet placidi pellacia ponti,
sic tibi si finita semel primordia quaedam 560
constitueS‚ aevom debebunt sparsa per omnem
disiectare aestus diversi materiai,
numquam in concilium ut possint compulsa coire
nec remorari in concilio nec 01030010 adaucta;
quorum utrumque palam fieri manifesta docet 103, 565
et res progigni et genitas procrescere posseJ
esse igitur genere in quovis primordia rerum
infinita palam est unde omnia suppeditantur.
Nec superare queunt motus itaque exitiales
perpetuo neque in aeternum sepelire salutem, 570
nec porro 10111111 genitales auctificique
motus perpetuo possunt servare creata.
sic aequo geritur certamine principiorum
ex infinito contractum tempore bellum:
nunc hic nunc illic superant vitalia rerum 575
et superantur item. miscetur funere vagor
quem pueri tollunt visentis luminis oras;

30011 floating about along every shore and utter to mortals a warning to
try to shun the suares and violence and guile of the faithless sea, and
never at any time to trust to it, when the winning face of calm ocean
laughs treacherously 3 thus too if you shall once decide that certain first-
beginnings are finite, different currents of matter must scatter and
tumble then about through all time, so that they can never be brought
into union and combine, nor abide in that union nor grow up and
increase. But plain matter of fact shews that each of these results
plainly takes place, that things can be brought into being and when
begotten advance in growth. It is clear then that in any class you
like the first-beginnings of things are infinite out of which all supplies
are furnished.

Thus then neither can death-dealing motions keep the mastery always
nor entomb existence for evermore, nor on the other hand can the birth
and increase giving motions of things preserve things always after they are
born. Thus the war of first-beginnings waged from eternity is carried
on with dubious issue: now here now there the life-bringing elements
of things get the mastery and are o'ermastered in turn: with the funeral
wail is blended the cry which babies raise when they enter the borders
