V 259

plorantis fugiunt summisso corpore plagas,

denique non hinnitus item differre videtur,

inter equas ubi equus florenti aetate iuvencus

pinnigeri saevit calcaribus ictus amoriS‚ 1075

et fremitum patulis ubi naribus edit ad arma,

et cum sic alias concussis artibus hinnit?

postremo genus alituum variaeque volucreS‚

accipitres atque ossifragae mergique marinis

fluctibus in salso victum vitamque petenteS, 1080

longe alias alio iaciunt in tempore voceS‚

et quom de victu certant praedaeque repugnant.

et partim mutant cum tempestatibus una

raucisonos cantuS, cornicum ut saecla vetusta

corvorumque greges ubi aquam dicuntur et imbris 108 5

ergo si varii sensus animalia cogunt,

muta tamen cum sint, varias emittere voceS,

quanto mortalis magis aecumst tum potuisse

when a young stallion in the flower of age rages among the mares smit-
ten by the goads of winged love, and when with wide· stretched nostrils
he snorts out the signal to arms, and when as it chauces on any other
occasion he neighs with limbs all shaking? Lastly the race of fowls
and the different winged creatures, hawks and osprays and gulls seeking
their living 111 the salt water mid the waves of the sea, utter at a differ-
ent time noises widely differing from those they make when they are
fighting for food and struggling with their prey. And some of them
change together with the weather their harsh croakings, as the long-
lived races of crows and flocks of rooks when they are said to be calling
for water and rain and sometimes to be summoning winds and gales.
Therefore if different sensations compel creatures, dumb though they be,
to utter different sounds how much more natural it 13 that mortal men
in those times should have been able to denote dissimilar things by many
different words 1

And lest haply on this head you ask in silent thought this question, it
was lightning that brought fire down 011 earth for mortals in the begin-
ning ; thence the whole heat of flames is spread abroad. Thus we see
