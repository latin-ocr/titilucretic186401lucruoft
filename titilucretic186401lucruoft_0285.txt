propter aquae rivom sub ramis arboris altae

non magnis opibus iucunde corpora habebant,

praesertim cum tempestas ridebat et anni 1395
tempora pingebant viridantis floribus herbas,

tum ioca, tum sermO, tum dulces esse cachinni
consuerant. agrestis enim tum musa vigebat 3 -

tum caput atque umeros plexis redimire coronis

floribus et foliis lascivia laeta monebat, 1400
atque extra numerum procedere membra moventes
duriter et duro terram pede pellere matrem3

unde oriebantur risus dulcesque cachinni,

omnia quod nova tum magis haec et mira vigebant.

et vigilantibus hinc aderant solacia somni, 1405
ducere multimodis voces et flectere cantus

et supra calamos unco percurrere labro 3

unde etiam vigiles nunc haec accepta tuentur

et numerum servare recens didicere, neque hilo
maiorem interea capiunt dulcedini’ fructum 1410
quam silvestre genus capiebat terrigenarum.

nam quod adest praest0‚ nisi quid cognovimus ante
suavius, in primis placet et pollere videtur,

posteriorque fere melior „res-filla reperta

perdit et immutat sensus ad pristina quaeque. 1415

a stream of water under the boughs of a high tree at no great cost they
would pleasantly refresh their bodies, above all when the weather smiled
and the seasons of the year painted the green grass with flowers. Then
went round the jest, the tale, the peals of merry laughter 3 for the pea-
sant muse was then in its glory 3 then frolic mirth would prompt to en-
twine head and shoulders with garlands plaited with flowers and leaves,
and to advance in the dance out of step and move the limbs clumsily
and with clumsy foot beat mother earth 3 which would occasion smiles
and peals of merry laughter, because all these things then from their
greater novelty and strangeness were in high repute. And the wakeful
found a solace for want of sleep in this, in drawing, out a variety of
notes·and going through tunes and running over the reeds with curving
lip 3 whence even at the present day watchmen observe these traditions
and have lately learned to keep the proper tune 3 and yet for all this re-
ceive not a jot more of enjoyment, than erst the rugged race of sons of
earth received. For that which we have in our hands, if we have known
before nothing pleasanter, pleases above all and is thought to be the
best 3 and as a rule the later discovery of something better spoils ὀΙιειμΠ

taste for the former things and changes the feelings in regard to all that
