e tenebris autem quae sunt in luce tuemur
propterea quia, curn propior caliginis aer
ater init oculos prior et possedit apertOS,
315 insequitur candens confestim lucidus aer 340
qui quasi purgat eos ac nigras discutit umbras
aeris illiusÍ¾ nam multis partibus hic est
mobilior multisque minutior et mage pollens,
qui simul atque vias oculorum luce replevit
320 atque patefecit quas ante obsederat aer 345
ater, continuo rerum simulacra secuntur
quae sita sunt in luce, lacessuntque ut videamus,
348 quod contra facere in tenebris e luce nequimus
propterea quia posterior caliginis aer
crassior insequitur qui cuncta foramina complet 350
obsiditque vias oculorum, ne simulacra

of the dark things which are in the light for this reason: when the black
air of darkness being the nearer has first entered and taken possession
of the open eyes, the bright white air follows straightway after and
cleanses them so to say and dispels the black shadows of the other air3
for this is a great deal more nimble, a great deal more subtle and more
efficacious. As soon as it has filled with light and opened up the passages
of the eyes which the black air had before blocked up, forthwith the idols
of things which are situated in the light follow and excite them so that we
see. This we cannot do conversely in the dark out of the light because
the grosser air. of darkness follows behind and quite fills all the openings
and blocks up the passages of the eyes, not letting the idols of any things
at all be thrown into the eyes to move them. Again when we descry
far off the square towers of a town they often appear to be round for
this reason: all the angles are seen from a distance 130 look obtuse, or
rather are not seen at all, and their blow is lost and their stroke never
makes its way to our sight, because while the idols are borne on through
much air, the air by repeated collisions blunts the stroke perforce.
When in this way all the angles have together eluded the sense, the
