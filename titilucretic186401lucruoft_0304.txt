multa, foraminibus liquidus quia transvolat ignis,
multaque perfringit, cum corpora fulminis ipsa 350
corporibus rerum inciderunt, qua texta tenentur.

during the cold fires are wanting and winds fail during the heat, and the
clouds then are not of so dense a body. When therefore the seasons of
heaven are between the two extremes, the different causes of thunder
and lightning all combine ; for the very cross·current of the year mixes
