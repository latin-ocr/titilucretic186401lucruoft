tempore de mortis nec delibare valemUSâ€š

quo minus esse diu possimus forte perempti.

proinde licet quot vis vivendo condere saecla3 1090
mors aeterna tamen nilo minus illa manebit,

1166 minus ille diu iam non erit, ex hodierno

lumine qui finem vitai fecit, et ille,

mensibus atque annis qui multis occidit ante.

from the time past in death nor 6611 we fiet anything away, whereby we
may haply be a less long time in the condition of the dead. Therefore you
may complete as many generations as you please during your life 3 none
the less however will that everlasting death await you3 and for no less
long a time will 116 be no more in being, who beginning with today has
ended 1115 life, than the man who 1165 died many months and years ago.
