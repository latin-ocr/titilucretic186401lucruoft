nec quos quaeque darent motus pepigere profectO,
sed quia multa modis multis primordia rerum
ex infinito iam tempore percita plagis
ponderibusque suis consuerunt concita ferri
omnimodisque coire atque omnia pertemptare, 425
quaecumque inter se possent congressa creare,
propterea fit uti magnum volgata per aevom
omne genus coetus et motus experiundo
tandem conveniant ea quae convecta repente
magnarum rerum fiunt exordia saepe, 430
terrai maris et caeli generisque animantum.
Hic neque tum solis rota cerni lumine largo
altivolans poterat nec magni sidera mundi
nec mare nec caelum nec denique terra neque aer
nec similis nostris rebus res ulla videri, 435
sed nova tempestas quaedam molesque coorta
440 omne genus de principiiS, discordia quorum
intervalla vias conexus pondera plagas
concursus motus turbabat proelia miscenS,
propter dissimilis formas variasque figuras 440
quod non omnia sic poterant coniuncta manere
445 nec motus inter sese dare convenientis
437 diffugere inde loci partes coepere paresque

sighted intelligence, nor did they bargain sooth to say what motions
each should assume, but because the first-beginnings of things many in
number in many ways impelled by blows for infinite ages back and kept
in motion by their own weights have been wont to be carried along and
to unite in all manner of ways and thoroughly to test every kind of
production possible by their mutual combinations‚ therefore it is that
spread abroad through great time after trying unions and motions of
every kind they at length meet together in those masses which suddenly
brought together become often the rudiments of great things, of earth
sea and heaven and the race of living things.

At this time then neither could the sun’s disk be discet-ned flying
alost with its abundant lightffinor sea nor heaven, no nor earth nor air,
nor could any thing be seen like to our things, but only a strange stormy

crisis and medley, gathered together out of first-beginnings of every kind,
⁶ whose state of discord joining battle disordered their interspaces passages
connexions weights blows clashings motionS‚ because by reason of their
unlike forms and varied shapes they could not all remain thus joined
together nor fall into mutually harmonious motions. Then next the

several parts began to fly asunder and things to be joined like with like
