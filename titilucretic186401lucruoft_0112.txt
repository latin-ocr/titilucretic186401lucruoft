100 II

quis regere immensi summam2 quis habere profundi 1095 -
indu manu validas potis est moderanter habenaS,

quis pariter caelos omnis convertere et omnis

ignibus aetheriis terras suffire feraciS,

omnibus inve locis esse omni tempore praestO,

nubibus ut tenebras faciat caelique serena 1 100
concutiat sonitU, tum fulmina mittat et aedis

saepe suas disturbet et in deserta recedens

saeviat exercens telum quod saepe nocentes

praeterit exanimatque indignos inque merentes?

Multaque post mundi tempus genitale diemque 1105
primigenum maris et terrae solisque coortum
addita corpora sunt extrinschS‚ addita circum
semina quae magnum iaculando contulit omne3
unde mare et terrae possent augescere et unde

appareret spatium caeli domus altaque tecta 1110
tolleret a terris procul et consurgeret aer.

nam sua cuique locis ex omnibus omnia plagis

corpora distribuuntur et ad sua saecla recedunt,

umor ad umorem, terreno corpore terra

crescit et ignem ignes procudunt aetheraque aether, 1115
donique ad extremam crescendi perfica finem

ruffied existence, who can rule the sun, who hold in his hand with
controlling force the strong reins of the immeasurable deep2 who can
at once make all the different heavens to roll and warm with ethereal
fires all the fruitful earths, or be present in all places at all times, to
bring darkness with clouds 'and shake with noise the heaven’s serene
expanse, to hurl lightnings and often throw down his own temples and
withdrawing into the deserts there to spend his rage in practising his

bolt which often passes the guilty by and strikes dead the innocent and
unoffending 2

And since the birth-time of the world and first day of being to sea
and earth and the formation of th'e sun many bodies have been added
from without, many seeds added all round, which the great universe in
tossing to and fro has contributed 3 that from-*them the sea and ⁵lands
might increase and from them heaven's mansion might enlarge its

expanse and raise its high vaults far above earth, and that air might
rise up around. For all bodies from all quarters are assigned by blows
each to its appropriate thing and all withdraw to their proper classes 3
moisture passes to moisture‚ from an earthy body earth increases and
fires forge fires and ether ether, until nature parent of things with
finishing hand hag brought all things on to their utmost limit of growth.
