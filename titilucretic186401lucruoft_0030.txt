si cita dissiliant, nempe aer omne necessest, 38 5
inter corpora quod fiat, possidat inane.

is porro quamvis circum celerantibus auris

confluat, haud poterit tamen uno tempore totum
compleri spatium; nam primum quemque necessest
occupet ille locum, deinde omnia possideantur. 390

quod si forte aliquiS, cum corpora dissiluere,

tum putat id fieri quia se condenseat aer,

errat, nam vacuum tum fit quod non fuit ante

et repletur item vacuum quod constitit ante,

nec tali ratione potest denserier aer, 395

nec, si iam posset, sine inani posset, opinor,

ipse in se trahere et partis conducere in unum.
Quapropter, quamvis causando multa moreriS,

esse in rebus inane tamen fateare necessest.

multaque praeterea tibi possum commemorando 400

argumenta fidem dictis conradere nostris,

verum animo satis haec vestigia parva sagaci

sunt per quae possis cognoscere cetera tute.

namque canes ut montivagae persaepe ferai

naribus inveniunt intectas fronde quieteS‚ 405

cum semel institerunt vestigia certa viai,

sic alid ex alio per te tute ipse videre

spring asunder, the air must surely fill all the void which is formed be-
tween the bodies. Well however rapidly it stream together with swist-
circling currents, yet the whole space will not be able to be filled up in
one moment, for it must occupy first one spot and then another, until
the whole is taken up. But if haply anyone supposes that, when the
bodies have started asunder, that result follows because the air con·
denses, he is mistaken 3 for a void is then formed which was not before,
and a void also is filled which existed before ; nor can the air condense
in such a way, nor supposing it could, could it methinks without void
draw into itself and bring its parts together.

Wherefore however long you hold out by urging many obJections‚
you must needs in the end admit that there is a void in things. 'And
many more arguments I may state to you in order to accumulate proof
on my words 3 but these slight footprints are enough for a keen-search-
ing mind to enable you by yourself to find out all the rest. For as dogs
often discover by smell the lair of a mountain-ranging wild beast though
covered over with leaves, when once they have got on the sure tracks,
thus you in cases like this will be able by yourself alone to see one thing
