quippe suam quicque in coetu variantis acervi 77 5

naturam ostendet mixtusque videbitur aer
cum terra simul atque ardor cum rore manere.
at primordia gignundis in rebus oportet
naturam clandestinam caecamque adhibere,
emineat nequid quod contra pugnet et obstet 780
quominus esse queat proprie quodcumque creatur.
Quin etiam repetunt a caelo atque ignibus eius
et primum faciunt ignem 86 vertere in auras

aeriS, hinc imbrem gigni terramque creari

ex imbri retroque a terra cuncta reverti, 78 5
umorem primum, post aera, deinde calorem,

nec cessare haec inter 86 mutare, meare

a caelo ad terram, de terra ad sidera mundi.

quod facere haud ullo debent primordia pacto;
immutabile enim quiddam superare necessest, 790
ne res ad nilum redigantur funditus 01111168.

nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,

continuo hoc mors est illius quod fuit ante.

quapropter quoniam quae paulo diximus ante

in commutatum veniunt, constare necessest 795
ex aliis ea, quae nequeant convertier usquam, ·

ne tibi res redeant ad nilum funditus omneS.

each thing amid the medley of this discordant mass will display its own
nature and air will be seen to be mixed up with earth and heat to
remain in union with moisture. But first-beginnings ought in begetting
things to bring with them a latent and unseen nature in order that no
thing stand out, to be in the way and prevent whatever is produced
from having its own proper being.

Moreover they go back to heaven and its fires for a beginning, and
first suppose that fire changes into‘air, next that from air water is begotten
and earth is produced out of water, and that all in reverse order come
back from earth, water first, next air, then heat, and that these cease
not to interchange, to pass from heaven to earth, from earth to the stars
of ether. All which first-beginnings must on no account (103 since
something unchangeable must needs remain over, that things may not
utterly be brought back to nothing. For whenever a thing changes
and quits its proper limits, at once this change of state is the death
of that which was before. Wherefore since those things which we have
mentioned a little before pass into a state of change, they must be formed
out of others which cannot in any case be transformed, that you may not
have things returning altogether to nothing. Why not rather hold that
