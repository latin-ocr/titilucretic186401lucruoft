multa loquens quoniam amittit de corpore partem.
551 asperitas autem vocis fit ab asperitate

principiorum et item levor levore creatur.
542 nec simili penetrant auris primordia forma,

cum tuba depresso graviter sub murmure mugit 545 {51²2

et reboat raucum regio „CJPQ ’barbara bombum,
545 et validis cycni torrentibus ex Heliconis
cum liquidam tollunt lugubri voce querellam.

Hasce igitur penitus voces cum corpore nostro
exprimimus rectoque foras emittimus ore, 5 50
mobilis articulat verborum daedala lingua

550 formaturaque labrorum pro parte figurat.
553 hoc ubi non longum spatiumst unde una profecta
perveniat vox quaeque, necessest verba quoque ipsa

plane exaudiri discernique articulatim3 5 55
servat enim formaturam servatque figuram.
at si interpositum spatium sit longius aeqUO,

aera per multum confundi verba necessest
et conturbari vocem, dum transvolat auras,

ergo fit, sonitum ut possis sentire neque illam 560
. internoscere, verborum sententia quae sit:
usque adeo confusa venit vox inque pedita.

a man by much speaking loses a portion from his body. Next roughness
of voice comes from roughness of the first-beginnings‚ as smoothness is
produced from smoothness. Nor are the first-beginnings of like shape
which pierce the ears in these two cases ι when the trumpet brays dully
in deep low tones, the barbarian country round echoing back the hoarse
hollow sound, and when swans from the headstrong torrents of Helicon
raise their clear-toned dirge with plaintive voice.

When therefore we force these voices forth from the depths of our
body and discharge them straight out at the mouth, the pliant tongue
deft fashioner of words gives them articulate utterance and the structure
of the lips does its part in shaping them. Thgrefore when the distance
is not long between the point from which each several voice has started
and that at which it arrives, the very words too must be plainly heard
and distinguished syllable by syllable 3 for each voice retains its structure
and retains its shape. But if the space between be more than is suitable,
the words must be huddled together in passing through much air and the
voice be disorganised in its fiight through the same. Therefore it is that
you can hear a sound, yet cannot distinguish what the meaning of the
words is t so huddled and hampered is the voice when it comes. Again
