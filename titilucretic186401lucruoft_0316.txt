guttai vix instar erunt unius adaugmen3

quo minus est mirum mare non augescere magnum. 615
praeterea magnam sol partem detrahit aestu,

quippe videmus enim vestis umore madentis

exsiccare suis radiis ardentibu' solem:

at pelage multa et late substrata videmus,

proinde licet quamvis ex uno quoque loco sol 620
umoris parvam delibet ab aequore partem3

largiter in tanto spatio tamen auferet undis,

tum porro venti quoque magnam tollere partem

umoris possunt verrentes aequora, ventis

una nocte vias quoniam persaepe videmus 625
siccari mollisque luti concrescere crustas,

praeterea docui multum quoque tollere nubes

umorem magno conceptum ex aequore ponti

et passim toto terrarum spargere in orbi,

cum pluit in terris et venti nubila portant. 630
postremo quoniam raro cum corpore tellus

est, et coniunctast, oras maris undique 6168668,

debet ut in mare de terris venit umor aquai,

in terras itidem manare ex aequore salso;

percolatur enim* virus retroque remanat 635
materies umoris et ad caput amnibus omnis

confluit, inde super terras redit agmine dulci

addition of bulk hardly amounting to a single drop 3 it is therefore the
less wonderful that the great sea does not increase. A gain the sun ab-
sorbs a great deal with his heat: we see him with his burning rays
thoroughly dry clothes dripping with wet: but we know seas to be many
in number and to stretch over a wide surface. Therefore however small
the portion of moisture which the sun draws off the surface from any
one spot 3 it will yet in so vast an expanse take largely from its waterS.
Then again the winds too may withdraw a great deal of moisture as
they sweep over the surface, since we very osten see the roads dried by
the winds in a single night and the soft mud form into hard crusts.
Again I have shewn that the clouds take off much moisture too imbibed
from the sut-face of the sea and scatter it about over the whole earth,
when 113 rains on land and the winds carry on the clouds. Lastly since
the earth is of a porous body and 18 in contact with the sea, girding its
shores 611 round, just as water comes from the earth into the sea, -in the
same way it must ooze into the land out of the salt sea3 for the salt 18 ,
strained off and the matter of liquid streams back again to the source
and all meets together at the river—heads, and then flows over the lands
