conventus hominum pompam convivia pugnaS,

omnia sub verbone creat natura paratque? 785
cum praesertim aliis eadem in regione locoque

longe dissimilis animus res cogitet omniS.

quid porro, in numerum procedere cum simulacra
cernimus in somnis et mollia membra movere,

mollia, mobiliter cum alternis bracchia mittunt 790
et repetunt oculis gestum pede convenienti?

scilicet arte madent simulacra et docta vagantur,
nocturno facere ut possint in tempore ludos,

an magis illud erit verum? quia tempore in un0‚

cum sentimus id, et cum vox emittitur una, 795
tempora multa latent, ratio quae comperit esse,
propterea fit uti quovis in tempore quaeque

praesto sint simulacra locis in quisque parata.

et quia tenvia sunt, nisi quae contendit, acute 802
cernere non potis est animus 3 proinde omnia quae sunt
praeterea pereunt, nisi siquae ad se ipse paravit.

command produce and provide? and though to increase the marvel the
mind of others in the same spot and room is thinking of things all quite

in measured tread and move their pliant limbs, pliant I say, when in
nimble wise they put out each arm in turn and represent to the eyes
over and over again an action with foot that moves in time‘} Idols to
wit are imbued with art and move about well—trained, to be able in the
night-time to exhibit such plays. Or will this rather be the truch
because in one unit of time, when we can perceive it by sense and while
one single word is uttered, many latent times are contained which
reason finds to exist, therefore in any time you please all the several
idols are at hand ready prepared in each several place. And because
they are so thing the mind can see distinctly only those which it strains
itself to see3 therefore all that there are besides are lost, save onlysfflucli
*as it has taken to itself. Moreover it makes itself ready and hopes to
see that which follows upon each thing 3 therefore the result does follow.
Do you not see that the eyes also, when they essay to discern things
which are thin and fine, strain themselves and make themselves ready,
