extremum quod habent, minimum consistere in illis.

huc accedit item, quoniam primordia rerum

mollia constituunt, quae nos nativa videmus

esse et mortali cum corpore funditus, utque 755

debeat ad nilum iam rerum summa reverti

de niloque renata vigescere copia rerum3

quorum utrumque quid a vero iam distet habebis

deinde inimica modis multis sunt atque veneno

ipsa sibi inter se ς quare aut congressa peribunt 760

aut ita diffugient ut tempestate coacta

fulmina diffugere atque imbris ventosque videmus
Denique quattuor ex rebus si cuncta creantur

atque in eas rursum res omnia dissoluuntur,

qui magis illa queunt rerum primordia dici 765

quam contra res illorum retroque putari?

alternis gignuntur enim mutantque colorem

et totam inter se naturam ternpore ab omni.

sin ita forte putas ignis terraeque coire 770

point, there is a least in them. Moreover since they assign soft first-
beginnings of things, which we see to have birth and to be of a body
altogether mortal, both the sum of things must in that case revert to
nothing and the store of things be born anew and flourish out of
nothing: now how wide of the truth both of these doctrines are
you will already comprehend. In the next place these bodies are
in many ways mutually hostile and poisonous, and therefore they
will either perish when they have met, or will fly asunder just as
we see, when a storm has gathered, lightnings and rains and winds
fly asunder.

Again if all things are produced from four things and all again
broken up into those things, how can they more be called first-beginnings
of things than things be called their first-beginnings, the supposition
being reversed? For they are begotten time about and interchange
0010111 and their whole nature without ceasing. But if haply you sup-
pose that the body of fire and of earth and air and the moisture of water
meet in such a way that none of them in the union changes its nature,
nothing I 0311 tell you will be able to be thus produced out of them,
neither living thing nor thing with inanimate body, as 3 tree3 in fact
