quod facit, et sequitur, donec pervenit ad ipsum 1015
iam lapidem caecisque in eo compagibus haesit.
hoc fit idem cunctas in partiS, unde vacefit
cumque locus, sive e transverso sive superne
corpora continuo in vacuum vicina feruntur3 ⁷
quippe agitantur enim plagis aliunde nec ipsa η 1020
sponte sua sursum possunt consurgere in auras
huc accedit item (quare queat id magis esse,
haec quoque res adiumento motuque iuvatur)
quod, simul a fronte est anelli rarior aer
factus inanitusque locus magis ac vacuatuS, 1025
1033 continuo fit uti qui post est cumque locatus
1026 aer a tergo quasi provehat atque propellat.
semper enim circumpositus res verberat aer 3
sed tali fit uti propellat tempore ferrum,
parte quod ex una spatium vacat et capit in se. 1030

ring following. This it does do, and follows on until it has quite reached
the stone and fastened on it with unseen bonds of connexion. The same
thing takes place in all directions: 011 whatever side a void is formed,
whether athwart or from above the first bodies next it are at once car-
ried on into the void 3 for they are set in motion by blows fr0m another
source and cannot by their own free will rise up into the air. Moreover
(to render it more feasible, this thing also is helped on by externa] aid
and motion) as soon as the air in front of the ring has been made rarei-
and the space more empty and void, it follows at once that au the air
which lies behind, carries and pushes it on as it were at its back, For
the air which lies around them always beats on things 3 but at such a
time as this it is able to push on the iron, because on one side a space is
void and receives the iron’into it, This air of which I am *speaking to
you makes its way with much subtlety through the frequent pores of
the iron to its minute parts and then thrusts and pushes it on,'as the
wind a ship and its sails. Again all things must have air in their body,
since they are of a rare body and air surrounds and is in contact with
all things, This air therefore which is in the inmost recesses of the
