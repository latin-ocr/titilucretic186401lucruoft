distrahitur magis, hoc magis est ut cernere possis
evanescere paulatim stinguique colorem3
ut fit ubi in parvas partis discerpitur austrum:
purpura poeniceusque color clarissimu' multe, 830
filatim cum distractum est, dispergitur omnisÍ¾
noscere ut hinc possis prius omnem efflare colorem
particulas quam discedant ad semina rerum.

Postremo quoniam non omnia corpora vocem
mittere concedis neque odorem, propterea fit 835
ut non omnibus adtribuas sonitus et odores

sic oculis quoniam non omnia cernere quimuS,
scire licet quaedam tam constare orba colore

quam sine odore ullo quaedam sonituque remota,
nec minus haec animum cognoscere posse sagacem 840
quam quae sunt aliis rebus privata notare.
Sed ne forte putes solo spoliata colore

et nardi florem, nectar qui naribus halat,

and become extinct3 as for instance if a piece of purple is torn into
small shreds: when it has been plucked into separate threadS, the
purple and the scarlet far the most brilliant of colours are quite
effaced3 from which you may infer that the shreds part with all their
colour before they come back to the seeds of things.

Lastly since you admit that all bodies do not utter a voice nor emit
a smell, for this reason you do not assign to all sounds and smells. So
also since we cannot perceive all things with the eye, you are to know
that some things are as much denuded of colour as others are without
smell and devoid of sound, and that the keen-discerning mind can just
as well apprehend these things as it can take note of things which
are destitute of other qualities.

But lest haply you suppose that first bodies remain stripped of
colour alone, they are also wholly devoid of warmth and cold and
violent heat, and are judged to be barren of sound and drained of
moisture, and emit from their body no scent of their own. Just as
when you set about preparing the balmy liquid of sweet marjoram and
myrrh and the fiower of spikenard which gives forth to the nostrils a
