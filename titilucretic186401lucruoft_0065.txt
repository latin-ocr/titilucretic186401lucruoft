ΙΙ 53

proficiunt neque nobilitas nec gloria regni,

quod superest, animo quoque nil prodesse putandum3

si non forte tuas legiones per loca campi 40
fervere cum videas belli simulacra cientis,

subsidiis magnis et ecum vi constabilitaS,

one spirit, thereupon you find that religious scruples scared by these
things fly panic-stricken from the mind 3 and that then fears of death
leave the breast unembarrassed and free from care, when you see your
fleet swarm forth and spread itself far and wide. But if we see that
these things are food for laughter and mere mockeries, and in good truth
the fears of men and dogging cares dread not the clash of arms and

stand not in awe of the glitter from gold nor the brilliant sheen of
the purple robe, how can you doubt that this is wholly the prerogative
of reason, whenathe whole of life withal is a struggle in the dark‘l For
even as children are flurried and dread all things in the thick darkness,
thus we in the daylight fear at times things not 3 whit more to be
dreaded than those at which children shudder in the dark and fancy
sure to be. This terror therefore and darkness of mind must be dis-
