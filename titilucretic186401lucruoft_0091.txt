ingratos animos atque impia- pectora volgi

conterrere metu quae possint numini' divae.

ergo cum primum magnas invecta per urbis

munificat tacita mortalis muta salute, 62 5
aere atque argento sternunt iter omne viarum

largifica stipe ditantes ninguntque rosarum

floribus umbrantes matrem comitumque catervas.

Phrygian Curetes, in that it haply joins in the game of arms and springs
up in measure all dripping with blood, shaking with its nonng the
frightful crests upon the head, represents the Dictaean Curetes who, as
‘the story is, erst drowned in Crete that infant cry of Jove, when the
young band about the young babe in rapid dance arms in hand to
measured tread beat brass on brass, that Saturn might not get him
to consign to his devouring jaws and stab the mother to the heart with
a never-healing wound. Therefore they escort in arms the great mother,
either because they mean by this sign that the goddess preaches to men
to be willing with arms and valour to defend their country and be ready
to be a safeguard and an ornament to their parents. All which, well
and beautifully as it is set forth and told, is yet widely removed from
