turbine caelesti subito correptus 01 igni? 395
cur etiam loca sola petunt frustraque laborant?

an tum bracchia consuescunt firmantque lacertos?

in terraque patris cur telum perpetiuntur

optundi2 cur ipse sinit neque parcit in hostis?

denique 0111· numquam caelo iacit undique puro 400
Iuppiter in terras fulmen sonitusque profundit?

an simul 30 nubes successere, ipse in eas tum

charged? or if he wills to crush us off our guard with his fire, why
thunders he from that side, to enable us to shun it? why stirs he vup

stroke was made 31 000 time? Nay often and often it has happened
