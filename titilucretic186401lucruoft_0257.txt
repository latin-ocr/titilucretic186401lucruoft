solque suos etiam dimittere languidus ignis

tempore cur certo nequeat recreareque lumen,

cum loca praeteriit flammis infesta per auras, 760

quae faciunt ignis interstingui atque perire?

et cur terra queat lunam spoliare vicissim

lumine et oppressum solem super ipsa tenere,

menstrua dum rigidas coni perlabitur umbras;

tempore eodem aliut nequeat succurrere lunae 765

corpus vel supra solis perlabier orbem,

quod radios interrumpat lumenque profusum?

et tamen ipsa suo si fulget luna nitore,

cur nequeat certa mundi languescere parte, v

dum loca luminibus propriis inimica per exit? 770
Quod superest, quoniam magni per caerula mundi

qua fieri quicquid posset ratione resolvi,

solis uti varios cursus lunaeque meatus

noscere possemus quae vis et causa cieret, 775

quove modo possent offecto lumine obire

et neque opinantis tenebris obducere terras,

cum quasi conivent et aperto lumine rursum

omnia convisunt clara loca candida luce,

nunc redeo ad mundi novitatem et mollia terrae 780

the air he has passed by spots fatal to his flames, which· cause his fires to

to rob the moon of light and moreover herself to keep the sun sup-
pressed‚ while in her monthly course she glides through the well-defined
shadows of the cone3 and yet at the same time another body not be
able to pass under the moon or glide above the sun’s orb, breaking off its
rays and the light it sheds forth? Yes and if the moon shines with her
own brightness, why should she not be able to grow faint in a certain
part of the world, while she is passing through spots hostile to her own
light.

And now further since I have explained in what way every thing
might take place throughout the azure heights of the great heaven ,· how
we might know what force and cause set in motion the varied courses of
the sun and wanderings of the moon ,· and in what way their light might
be intercepted and they be lost to us and spread darkness over the earth
little expecting it, when so to speak they close their eye of light and open-
ing it again do fill all places shining in bright radiance‚ I now go back
to the infancy of the world and the tender age of the fields of earth and
