sage, heat through that, and one thing is seen to pass through by the
same way more quickly than other things, The nature of the passages,
you are to know, compels it so to be, varying in manifold wisc, as we
have shewn a little above, owing to the unlike natures and textures of
things.

Therefore now that these points have all been established and ar·-
ranged for us ἐξ premis-ses> ready to our hand, for what remains, the law
will readily be explained out of them, and the whole cause be laid open
which attracts the strength of iron. First of all there must stream from
this stone very many seeds or a current if you will which dispels with
blows all the air which lies between the stone and iron. When this
space is emptied and much room left void between, forthwith the first-
beginnings of iron fall headlong forward into the void in one body, and
in consequence the ring itself follows and then goes on with its whole
body. And nothing has its primal elements more intricately entangled
or coheres in closer connexion than the nature of stubborn iron and its
coldness that makes you shiver. Therefore what I say is the less strange,
that from among such elements as these bodies cannot gather in large
numbers out of the iron and be carried into the void without the whole
