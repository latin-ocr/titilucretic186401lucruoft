multa videmus enim caelestibus inlita flammis
fulgere, cum caeli donavit plaga vapore. 1095
et ramosa tamen* cum ventis pulsa vacillans
aestuat in {amos incumbens arboris arbor,
exprimitur validis extritus viribus ignis
et micat interdum flammai fervidus ardor,
mutua dum inter se rami stirpesque teruntur. 1100
quorum utrumque dedisse potest mortalibus ignem.
inde cibum coquere ac flammae mollire vapore
sol docuit, quoniam mitescere multa videbant
verberibus radiorum atque aestu victa per agros,
Inque dies magis hi victum vitamque priorem 1105
commutare novis monstrabant rebu' benigni,
ingenio qui praestabant et corde vigebant.
condere coeperunt urbis arcemque locare
praesidium reges ipsi sibi perfugiumque,
et pecus atque agros divisere atque dedere 1110
pro facie cuiusque et viribus ingenioque3
nam facies multum valuit viresque vigentes,
posterius res inventast aurumque repertum,
quod facile et validis et pulchris dempsit honorem;

divitioris enim sectam plerumque secuntur 1115

many things shine dyed in flames of heaven, when the stroke from
heaven has stored them with its heat. Ay anQssSideS this when a
branching tree sways to and fro and tosses about under the buffeting of
the winds, pressing against the boughs of another tree, fire is forced out
by the power of the violent friction, and sometimes the burning heat of
flame fiashes out, the boughs and stems rubbing against each other.
Now either of these accidents may have given fire to men. N ext the
sun taught them to cook food and soften it with the heat of flame, since
they would see many things grow mellow, when subdued by the strokes
of the rays and by heat throughout the fields.

And more and more every day men who excelled in intellect and
were of vigorous understanding, would kindly show them how to ex-
change their former way of living for new methods. Kings began to
build towns and lay out a citadel as a place of strength and of refuge for
themselves, and divided cattle and lands and gave to each man in pro-
portion to his personal beauty and strength and intellect 3 for beauty and
vigorous strength were much esteemed. Afterwards wealth was dis-
covered and gold found out, which soon robbed of their honours strong
and beautiful alike 3 for men however valiant and beautiful of person
