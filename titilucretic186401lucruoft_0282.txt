deplexaeque dabant in terram volnere victos„

morsibus adfixae validis atque unguibus uncis,
iactabantque suos tauri pedibusque terebant

et latera ac ventres hauribant supter equorum

cornibus et terram minitanti fronte ruebant. 132 5
et validis socios caedebant dentibus apri

tela infracta suo tinguentes sanguine saevi, '

in se fracta suo tinguentes sanguine tela,

permixtasque dabant equitum peditumque ruinas.

nam transversa feros exibant dentis adactus 1330
iumenta aut pedibus ventos erecta petebant,

nequiquam, quoniam ab nervis succisa videres

concidere atque gravi terram consternere casn.

siquos ante domi domitos satis esse putabant,
effervescere cernebant in rebus agundis 1335
volneribus clamore fuga terrore tumultu,

ut nunc saepe boves lucae ferro male mactae

diffugiunt, fera fata suis cum multa dedere. 1340

would tear down from behind and twining round them would bring them
to the ground overpowered by the wound, fastening on them with firm
bite and with hooked claws. The bulls would toss their own friends and
trample them under foot, and gore with their horns the flanks and bellies
of the horses underneath and turn up the earth with thr-eatening front.
The boars too would rend their friends with powerful tusks, in their
rage dying with their blood the weapons broken in them, dying with
their blood I say the weapons broken in their own bodies; and would
put to promiscuous rout horse and foot 3 for the tame beasts would try
to avoid by shying to the side the cruel push of the tusk, or would rear
up and paw the winds, all in vain, since you might see them tumble
down with their tendons severed and straw the ground in their heavy
fall. Those whom they believed before to have been sufficiently broken
in already, they would see lash themselves into fury in the heat of action
from wounds shouting flight panio uproar 3 and they could not rally any
portion of them 3 for all the different kinds of wild-beasts would fly all
abroad 3 just as now the lucan kine when cruelly mangled by the sword
fiy often all abroad, after inflicting on their friends many cruel deaths·
