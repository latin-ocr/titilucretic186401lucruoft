nec porro poterunt ipsi reprehendere sese,

et si non poterit ratio dissolvere causam, 500
cur ea quae fuerint iuxtim quadrata, procul sint

visa rutunda, tamen praestat rationis egentem

reddere mendose causas utriusque figurae,

quam manibus manifesta suis emittere 'quoquam

from one source, sounds from another. It must follow therefore that any
one sense cannot confute any other. No nor can any sense take itself
to task, since equal credit must be assigned to it at all times. What
therefore has at any time appeared true to each sense, is true. And if
reason shall be unable to explain away the cause why things which
close at hand were square, at a distance looked round, it yet is better, if
you are at a loss for the reason, to state erroneously the causes of each
shape, than to let slip from your grasp on any side things manifest and
ruin the groundwork of belief and wrench up all the foundations on
which rest life and existence. For not only would all reason give way,
life itself would at once fall to the ground, if you dare not trust the
senses and shun precipices and all things else of this sort that are to be
avoided, and pursue the opposite things. All that host of words then is
quite unmeaning, which has been drawn out in array against the senses.
Once more, as in a building, if the rule first applied is wry, and the
square is untrue and swerves from its proper lines, and if there is the
slightest hitch in any part of the level, all the construction must be
faulty, all must be wry crooked sloping, leaning forwards‚ leaning back-
