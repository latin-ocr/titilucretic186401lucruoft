spread over the whole body, the tongue salter, the voice die away, a mist
cover the eyes, the ears ring, the limbs sink under one 3 in short we
often see men drop down from terror of mind, so that anybody may
easily perceive from this that the soul is closely united with the mind,
and, when it has been smitten by the influence of the mind, forthwith
pushes and strikes the body.

This same principle teaches that the nature of the mind and soul is
bodily 3 for when it is seen to push the limbs, rouse the body from sleep‚
and alter the countenance and guide and turn about the whole man, and
when we see that none of these effects can take place without touch nor
touch without body, must we not admit that the mind and the soul are
of a bodily nature? Again you perceive that our mind in our body
suffers together with the body and feels in unison with it. When a
weapon with a shudder-causing force has been driven in and has laid
bare bones and sinews within the body, if it does not take life, yet there
ensues a faintness and a lazy sinking to the ground and on the ground
the turmoil of mind which arises, and sometimes a kind of undecided

inclination to get up. Therefore the nature of the mind must be bodily, ·

since it suffers from bodily weapons and blows.
