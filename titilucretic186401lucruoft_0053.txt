iamne vides igitur, paulo quod diximus ante,
permagni referre eadem primordia saepe
cum quibus et quali positura contineantur
et quos inter se dent motus accipiantque, 910
atque eadem paulo inter se mutata creare
ignes et lignum? quo pacto verba quoque ipsa
inter se paulo mutatis sunt 616111611116,
611111 ligna atque ignes distincta voce notemus
denique iam quaecumque in rebus cernis apertis 915
61 fieri non posse 1111166, quin materiai
corpora consimili natura praedita fingas,
hac ratione tibi pereunt primordia rerum:
fiet uti risu tremulo concussa cachinnent

nately. Do you now see, as we said a little before, that it often makes
a very great difference with what things and in what position the same
first-beginnings are held in union and what motions they naturally
impart and receive, and that the same may when 6 little changed in
arrangement produce say fires and a fir? just as the words too consist
of elements only a little changed in arrangement, though we denote firs
and fires with two quite distinct names. Once again, if you suppose
that whatever you perceive among visible things cannot be produced
without imagining bodies possessed of a like nature, in this way, you
will find, the first-beginnings of things are destroyed: it will come to
this that they will be shaken by loud fits of convulsive laughter and will
bedew with salt tears face and cheeks.

Now mark and learn what remains to be known and hear it more
distinctly. N or does my mind fail to perceive how dark the things are 3

but the great hope of praise has smitten my heart with sharp thyrsus, “

and at the same time has struck into my breast sweet love of the muses,
with which now inspired I traverse in blooming thought the pathless
haunts of the Pierides never yet trodden by sole of man. I love to
approach the untasted springs and to quaff, I love to cull fresh flowers
