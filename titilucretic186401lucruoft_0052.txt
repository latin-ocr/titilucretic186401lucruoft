cum lapidi lapidem terimus, manare cruorem.
consimili ratione herbis quoque saepe decebat 885
et laticis dulcis guttas similique sapore
mittere, lanigerae quali sunt ubere lactiS,
scilicet 'et glebis terrarum saepe friatis
herbarum genera et fruges frondesque videri
dispertita inter terram latitare minute, 890
postremo in lignis cinerem fumumque videri,
cum praefracta forent, ignisque latere minutos,

and when we rub one stone on another, blood should ooze out. For
like reasons it were fitting that grasses too should yield drops of a sweet
liquid, like in flavour to those which a sheep has in its udder of milk3
yes and that often, when clods of earth have been crumbled, kinds of
grasses and corn and leaves should be found to lurk distributed among
the earth in minute quantities 3 and lastly that ash and smoke and minute
fires should be found latent in woods, when they were broken off. “ Now
since plain matter of fact teaches that none of these results follows, you
are to know that things are not so mixed up in things 3 but rather seeds
common to many things must in many ways be mixed up and latent in
things.

‘ But it often comes to pass on high mountains’ you say ‘that con-
tiguous tops of tall trees rub together, the strong southwinds constraining
them so to do, until the flower of flame has broken out and they have
burst into a blaze.' Quite true and yet fire is not innato in woods 3 but
there are many seeds of heat, and when they by rubbing have streamed
together, they produce conflagrations in the forests. But if the fiame was

any length of time, but would destroy forestS, burn up trees indiscrimi-
