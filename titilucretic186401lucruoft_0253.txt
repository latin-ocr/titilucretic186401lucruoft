multa videmus enim, certo quae tempore fiunt
omnibus in rebus, florescunt tempore certo 670
arbusta et certo dimittunt tempore florem.
nec minus in certo dentes cadere imperat aetas
tempore et inpubem molli pubescere veste
et pariter mollem malis demittere barbam.
fulmina postremo nix imbres nubila venti 675
non nimis incertis fiunt in partibus anni.
namque ubi sic fuerunt causarum exordia prima
atque ita res mundi cecidere ab origine prima,
conseque quoque iam redeunt ex ordine certo,
Crescere itemque dies licet et tabescere nocteS‚ 680
et minui 111066, 011111 sumant augmina nocteS,
aut quia sol idem sub terras atque superne
imparibus currens amfractibus* aetheris oras

down equally from each cheek. Lastly lightnings snow 161116 clouds
winds take place at not very irregular seasons of year. For where
causes from their very first 11681οω1186 have been 111 this way and things
have thus fallen out from the first birth of the world, in due sequence
too they now come round aster a fixed order.

Likewise days may lengthen and nights wane, and days shorten
when the nights receive increase, either because the same sun running
his course below the earth and above in curves of unlike length parts
the borders of ether and divides his orbit into unequal halves 3 and as he
0011166 round adds on in the opposite half just as much as he has sub-
tracted from the other of the two halves, until he has arrived at that
sign of heaven, where the node of the year makes the shades of night of

ι the same length 66 the daylighb. For when the sun's course lies midway

between the blast of the north and of the south, heaven keeps his two
goals apart at distances now rendered exactly equal on account of the
