sed magni referre ea primum quantula constent,
sensile quae faciunt, et qua sint praedita forma, 895
motibus ordinibus posituris denique quae sint.
quarum nil rerum in lignis glaebisque videmus3
et tamen haec, cum sunt quasi putrefacta per imbreS,
vermiculos pariunt, quia corpora materiai
antiquis ex ordinibus permota nova re 900
conciliantur ita ut debent animalia gigni.
deinde ea, sensilibus qui sensile posse creari
constituunt porro ex aliis, sentire sue'ta
mollia iam faciunt. narn sensus iungitur omnis
visceribus nervis veniS, quae cuique videmus 905
mollia mortali consistere corpore creta.
sed tamen esto iam posse haec aeterna manere:
nempe tamen debent aut sensum partis habere
aut simili totis animalibus esse putari.
at nequeant per se partes sentire necesse est; 910
namque alio sensus membrorum respicit omnis,
nec manus a nobis potis est secreta neque ulla
corporis omnino sensum pars sola tenere.

minute the particles are which make up the sensible thing and then
what shape they possess and what in short they are in their motions

clods; and yet even these things, when they have so to speak become
rotten through the rains, bring forth worms, because bodies of matter
driven from their ancient arrangements by a new condition are com-
bined in the same way as when living creatures are to be begotten.
Next they who hold that the sensible can-be produced anew out of other
sensible things, in that case suppose those things, accustomed thus to
have sense, to be soft3 for all sense is bound up with flesh sinews
veins3 which in everything we see to be soft and formed of a mortal
body. But even suppose that these things can remain eternal: they
must· yet I presume either have the sense of some part or else be
supposed to possess a sense similar to the entire living creatures. But
the parts cannot possibly have sense by themselves alone3 for all sense
of the different members has reference to something else3 nor can
the hand when severed from us nor any other part of the body whatever
by itself maintain sensation. It remains to assume that they resemble
the entire living creatureS. In this case it is necessary that they should
