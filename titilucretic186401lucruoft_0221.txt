namque aliis rebus concrescunt semina membris

‚ atque aliis extenvantur tabentque vicissim.
et quibus ipsa modis tractetur blanda voluptaS,
id quoque permagni refert3 nam more ferarum
quadrupedumque magis ritu plerumque putantur 1265
concipere uxoreS, quia sic loca sumere possunt,
pectoribus positiS, sublatis semina lumbis,
nec molles opu' sunt motus uxoribus hilum.
nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque repugnat,
clunibus ipsa viri Venerem si laeta retractat 1270
atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctus ;
eicit enim sulcum recta regione viaque
vomeris atque locis avertit seminis ictum.

And in what modes the intercourse goes on, is likewise of very great
moment 3 for women are commonly thought to conceive more readily
after the manner of wild-beasts and quadrupedS, because the seeds in
this way can find the proper spots, in consequence of the position of the
body. Nor have wives the least use for effeminate motions: a woman
hinders and stands in the way of her own conceiving, when thus she

acts ς’ for she drives the furrow out of the direct course and path of the -.

share and turns away from the proper spots the stroke of the seed.
And thus for their own ends harlots are wont to move, in order not to
conceive and lie in child-bed frequently, and at the same time to render
Venus more attractive to men. This our wives would seem to have no
need for.

Sometimes ¹ too by no divine grace and arrows of Venus a sorry
woman of inferior beauty comes to be loved 3 for the woman sometimes
by her own acts and accommodating manners and by elegant neatness of
person readily habituatcs you to pass your life with her. Moreover
custom renders love attractive 3 for that which is struck by oft-repeated
