tanto posse minus cum caeli turbine ferri.

evanescere enim rapidas illius et acris 625
imminui supter viriS‚ ideoque relinqui

paulatim solem cum posterioribu' signis,

inferior multo quod sit quam fervida signa.

et magis hoc lunam: quanto demissior eius

cursus abest procul a caelo terrisque propinquat, 630
tanto posse minus cum signis tendere cursum.

flaccidiore etenim quanto iam turbine fertur

inferior quam sol, tanto magis omnia signa

hanc adipiscuntur circum praeterque feruntur.

propterea fit ut haec ad signum quodque reverti 635
mobilius videatur, ad hanc quia signa revisunt.

fit quoque ut e mundi transversis partibus aer sa ·. »λ’ *¹

alternis certo fluere alter tempore possit,

qui queat aestivis solem detrudere signis

brumalis usque ad flexus gelidumque rigorem, 640
et qui reiciat gelidis a frigoris umbris

aestiferas usque in partis et fervida signa.

et ratione pari lunam stellasque putandumst,

quae volvunt magnos in magnis orbibus annOS,

aeribus posse alternis e partibus ire. 645
nonne vides etiam diversis nubila ventis

less they can be carried along with the whirl of heaven; for the velocity
of its force, he says, passes away and the intensity diminishes in the
lower parts, and therefore the sun is gradually left behind with the
rearward signs, because he is much lower than the burning signs. And

the moon more than the sun: the lower her path is and the more distant
she is from heaven and the nearer she approaches to earth, the less she
can keep pace with the signs. For the fainter the whirl is in which she
is borne along, being as she is lower than the sun, so much the more all
the signs around overtake and pass her. T herefore it is that she ap-
pears to come back to every sign more quickly, because the signs go
more quickly back to her. It is quite possible too that from quarters of
the world crossing the sun's path two airs may stream each in its turn at
a fixed time; one of which may force the sun away from the summer
signs so far as his midwinter turning-point and freezing cold, and the
other may force him back from the freezing shades of cold as far as
the beat-laden quarters and burning signs. And in like manner we
must suppose that the moon, and the stars which make revolutions of
great years in great orbits may pass by means of ai1s from opposite
quarters in turn. See you not too that clouds from contrary winds
