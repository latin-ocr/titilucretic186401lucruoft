ex homine humanum semen ciet una hominis viS. 1040
quod simul atque suis eiectum sedibus exit,
per membra atque artus decedit corpore toto
in loca conveniens nervorum certa cietque
continuo partis genitalis corporis ipsas
inritata tument loca semine fitque voluntas 1045
eicere id quo se contendit dira lubido,
idque petit corpus, mens unde est 8311613 amore.
namque omnes plerumque cadunt in vulnus et illam
emicat in partem sanguis unde icimur 10111, 1050
61 81 60111111111118 681, hostem ruber occupat umor.
sic igitur Veneris qui telis accipit ictus,
sive puer membris muliebribus hunc iaculatur
8611 mulier toto iactans e corpore amorem,

their wound and the blood spirts out in that direction whence 6011168 1116
stroke by which we are struck 3 and if he is at close quarters, the red
stream covers the foe. Thus then he who gets a hurt from the weapons
of Venus, whatever be the object that hits him, be it 3 woman breathing
love from her whole body, he inclines to the quarter whence he is
wounded, and yearns to unite with it and join body with body 3 for a
mute desire gives 3 presage of the pleasure.

This pleasure is for us Venus ,- from that desire is the Latin name of
love, from that desire has first trickled into the heart yon drop of Venus’
honeyed joy and soon 18 replaced by chilly care ; for though that which
