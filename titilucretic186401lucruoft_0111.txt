conicere in loca quaeque queat simili ratione
atque huc sunt coniecta, necesse est confiteare
esse alios aliis terrarum in partibus orbis 1075
et varias hominum gentis et saecla ferarum.
Huc accedit ut in summa res nulla sit una,
unica quae gignatur et unica solaque crescat,
quin aliquoiu' siet saecli permultaque eodem
sint genere. in primis 611111161111118, inclute Memmi, 1080
invenies 816 montivagum genus 6886 ferarum,
sic hominum genitam prolem, sic denique mutas
squamigerum pecudes et corpora cuncta volantum.

quandoquidem vitae depactus terminus alte

quam genus omne quod 1116 generatimst rebus abundans,
Quae bene cognita 81 1611668, natura videtur 1090

they are thrown together into our world, you must admit that in other
parts of space there are other earths and various races of men and kinds

Moreover in the sum of 61] there is no one thing which is begotten
single in its kind and grows up single and sole of its kind 3 but a thing
always belongs to some class and there are many other things in the
same kind. First in the case of living things, most noble MemmiuS,
you will find that in this sort has been begotten the mountain-ranging
race of wild beasts, in this sort the breed of men, in this sort toothe
mute 8110618 of scaly creatures and all bodies of fowls. Wherefore on a
like principle you must admit that earth and sun moon sea and all
things else that are, are not single in their kind, but rather of a number
past numbering 3 since the deep-set boundary-mark of life just as much
awaits these and they are just 68 much of a body that had birth, as any
class of things which here on earth abounds in samples of its kind.

If you well apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature free at

of herself without the meddling of the gods. For I 61111661 to the holy
