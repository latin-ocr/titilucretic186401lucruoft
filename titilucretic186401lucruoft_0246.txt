inde alium supra fluere atque intendere eodem

quo volvenda micant aeterni sidera mundi3

aut alium supter, contra qui subvehat orbern, 515
ut fluvios versare rotas atque haustra videmus,

est etiam quoque uti possit caelum omne manere

in statione, tamen cum lucida signa ferantur3

sive quod inclusi rapidi sunt aetheris aestus
quaerentesque viam circum versantur 01 ignes 520
passim per caeli volvunt immania templa;

sive aliunde fluens alicunde extrinsecus aer

versat agens ignis; sive ipsi serpere possunt

quo cuiusque cibus vocat atque invitat euntiS,

flammea per caelum pascentis corpora passim. 525
nam quid in hoc mundo sit eorum ponere certum
difficile est3 sed quid possit fiatque per omne

in variis mundis varia 13110110 0103118,

111 doceo plurisque sequor disponere 0311838,

it in at both ends 3 and then that 3 third air streams above and moves
in the 831110 (1110011011 111 which roll on as they shine the stars of the
eternal world; or else that this third air streams below in order 10 carry
up the sphere 111 the contrary direction ; just as we 800 rivers turn wheels
and water-scoops. Itis likewise quite po=sible 100 11131 311 1110 heaven
remains at rest, while 31 the same time the glittering signs are carried
on3 either because rapid heats of ether are shut in and whirl round
while secking a way 0111 and roll their fires in all directions through
heaven’s vast quarters 3 or else an air streaming from some part from
another source outside drives and whirls the fires; or else they may
glide on of themselves going whithersoever the food of each calls and
invites them, feeding their fiamy bodies everywhere throughout heaven.
For which of these causes is in operation in this world, it is not easy to
affirm for certain3 but what 0311 be and 18 done throughout the universe
in various worlds formed on various plans, this I teach‚ and I go on to
801 forth several causes which may exist throughout the universe for the
1110110118 of stars 3 one of which however must in this world also be the
cause that imparts lively motion to the signs3 but 10 801110 absolutely

which of them it is, is by no means the duty of the man who advances
step by step.
