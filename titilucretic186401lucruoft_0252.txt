diversas ire in partis inferna supernis?
· qui minus illa queant per magnos aetheris orbis
aestibus inter se diversis sidera ferri?
At nox obruit ingenti caligine 1561133, 650
aut ubi de longo cursu sol ultima caeli
impulit atque suos efflavit languidus ignis
concussos itere et labefactos aere 111111150,
aut quia sub terras cursum convortere cogit
vis eadem, supra quae terras pertulit orbem. 655
Tempore item certo roseam Matuta per oras
aetheris auroram differt et lumina pandit,
aut quia sol idem, sub terras ille revertenS,
anticipat caelum radiis accendere temptans,
aut quia conveniunt ignes et semina multa 660
confluere ardoris consuerunt tempore cert0‚
quae faciunt solis nova semper lumina gigni3
quod genus Idaeis fama est e montibus altis
dispersos ignis orienti lumine cerni,
inde coire globum quasi in unum et conficere orbem. 665
nec tamen illud in his rebus mirabile debet
esse, quod haec ignis 153111 061150 tempore possunt

semina confluere et solis reparare nitorem.

pass in contrary directionS, the upper in 3 contrary way to the lower?
Why may not yon stars just as well be borne on through their great
orbits in ether by currents contrary one to the other?

But night buries the earth in thick darkness, either when the sun
after his long course has struck upon the utmost parts of heaven and
now exhausted has blown forth all his fires shaken by their journey and
weakened by passing through much air 3 or else because the same force
which has carried on his orb above the earth, compels him to change his
course and pass below the earth.

At a fixed time too Matuta spreads rosy morning over the borders
of ether and opens up her light, either because the same sun, coming
back below the earth, seizes heaven before his time trying to kindle
it with his rays 3 or because fires meet together and many seeds of heat
are accustomed to stream together at a fixed timej which cause new
sunlight to be born every day. 1 Thus they tell that from the high
mountains of Ida scattered fires are seen at day-break, that these then
unite as it were into 3 single ball and make up an orb. And herein it
ought to cause no surprise that these seeds of fire stream together at a

time so surely fixed and reproduce the radianoe of the 31111. For we see
