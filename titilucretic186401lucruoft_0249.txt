V 23'7
nam prius omnia, quae longe semota tuemur
aera per multum, specie confusa videntur 580
quam minui filum. quapropter luna necesse est,
quandoquidem claram speciem certamque figuram
praebet, ut est oris extremis cumque notata
quantaque quantast hinc nobis videatur in 3110.
postremo quoscumque vides hinc aetheris ignes; 585
quandoquidem quoscumque in terris cernimus 1391108,
dum tremor est claruS‚ dum cernitur ardor eorum,
perparvom quiddam interdum mutare videtur
alteram utram in partem filum, quo longius absunt3
594 scire licet perquam pauxillo posse minores 590
esse vel· exigua maioris parte brevique.
590 Illud item non est mirandum, qua ratione
tantulus 1110 queat tantum sol mittere lumen,
quod maria ac terras omnis caelumque rigando
compleat et calido perfundat cuncta vapore. 595
597 113111 11001 111110 mundi patefactum totius unum
largifluum sontem scatere atque erumpere lumen,
ex omni mundo quia sic elementa vaporis
undique conveniunt et sic coniectus eorum 600
confluit, ex uno capite hic ut profluat ardor.

presents to our eyes seems 10 113 10 be. For all things which we see at
a great distance through much air, look dimmed in appearance before
their size 13 diminished. Therefore since the moon presents a bright
aspect and well-defined form, it must be seen on high by us from 11113
earth precisely 3311 13 111 the outline which defines it, and of the 31Ζο
11 actually 13. Lastly in the case of all those fires of ether which you
observe from this earth,—since in the case of fires which we see here on
earth, 30 long 33 111011· ffickering 13 distinct, so long 33 their heat 13
perceived‚ their 312013 30011 sometimes to change to a very very small
extent either way, according to the distance at which they are‚——you
may infer that the fires of ether may be smaller than they look in
an extremely minute degree, or larger by a very small and insignificant
fraction.

This likewise need not excite wonder, how it 13 11131 so small a body
as yon sun can emit so great a light, enough to flood completely seas and
all lands and heaven and tosteep all things in its burning 11031. It well
may be that a single spring for the whole world may open up from this
spot and gush out in plenteous stream and shoot forth light, because
elements of heat meet together from all sides out of the whole world in
such manner and the mass of them thrown together streams to a point
