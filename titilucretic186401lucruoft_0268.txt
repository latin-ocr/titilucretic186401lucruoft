Î‡ subdola pellicere in fraudem ridentibus undis, 1005
IMPROBA NAVIGII RA'r10 TUM CAECA IACEBAT

tum penuria deinde cibi languentia leto

membra dabat, contra nunc rerum copia mersat.

illi inprudentes ipsi sibi saepe venenum

vergebant, nunc dant aliis sollertius ipsi. 1010
Inde casas postquam ac pellis ignemque pararunt,

et mulier coniuncta viro concessit in unum

conubium, prolemque ex se videre creatam,

tum genus humanum primum mollescere coepit.

ignis enim curavit ut alsia corpora frigus 1015

non ita iam possent caeli sub tegmine ferre,

et Venus inminuit viris puerique parentum

blanditiis facile ingenium fregere superbum.

tunc et amicitiem coeperunt iungere aventes

finitimi inter se nec laedere nec violari, 1020

et pueros commendarunt muliebreque saeclum,

vocibus et gestu cum balbe significarent

imbecillorum esse aecum misererier omnis

nec tamen omnimodis poterat concordia gigni,

sed bona magnaque pars servabat foedera caste3 102 5

aut genus humanum iam tum foret omne peremptum

nec potuisset adhuc perducere saecla propagO.

would consign to death their fainting frames, now on the contrary tis
plenty sinks into ruin. They unwittingly would often pour out poison
for themselves 3 now with nicer skill men give it purposely to others.

Next after they had got themselves huts and skins and fire, and the
woman united with the man passed into the bonds of marriage with one,
and they saw an offspring born from them, then first mankind began to
soften. For fire made their chilled bodies less able now to bear the
frost beneath the canopy of heaven, and Venus impaired their strength
and children with their caresses soon broke down the haughty temper of
parents. Then too neighbours began to join in a league of friendship
mutually desiring neither to do nor suffer harm 3 and asked for indul-
gence to children and womankind, when with ories and gestures they
declared in stammering speech that meet it is for all to have met-cy
on the weak. And though harmony could not be established without
exception, yet a very large portion observed their agreements with good
saith, or else the race of man would then have been wholly cut off, nor
could the breed have continued their generations to this day.
