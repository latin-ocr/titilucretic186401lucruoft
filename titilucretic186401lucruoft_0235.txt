undique declarat. sed primum quicquid aquai
tollitur in 3111111116(1116 fit ut nil umor abundet, 265
partim quod validi verrentes aequora venti
diminuunt radiisque retexens aetherius sol,
partim quod supter per terras diditur omnis;
percolatur 6111111 virus retroque remanat
materies umoris et ad caput amnibus omnis 270
convenit, inde super terras fluit agmine dulci
qua via secta semel liquido pede detulit undas
Aera nunc igitur dicam qui corpore toto
innumerabiliter privas mutatur in 110163.

semper enim, quodcumque fluit de 1611113, 1(1 0111116 275
66113 111 magnum fertur mare; qui nisi contra

corpora retribuat rebus recreetque 1111611113,
01111116 16111 resoluta forent et in aera versa.

haut igitur cessat gigni de rebus et in res
reccidere, adsidue quoniam fluere omnia constat. 280

Largus item liquidi fons 11111111113, aetherius sol,
inrigat adsidue caelum candore recenti

then the water on the surface 13 always taken off, and thus it is that 011
the whole there 13 110 overflow‚ partly because the seas are lessened

by the strong winds sweeping over them and by the ether eal sun decom-
posing them with his rays5 partly because the water 13 diffused below
the surface over all lands ,· for the salt is strained off and the matter of
liquid streame back again to the source and all meets together at the
river-heads, and then fiows over the lands in a fresh current, where a
6116111161 01166 scooped out 1163 carried down the waters with liquid foot.

And next Ι will spe-ak of the air which is changed over its whole
body every hour in countless ways. For whatever ebbs from things, 13
611 1101116 always into the great sea of air 3 and unless it in return were
to give back bodies to things and to recruit them as they ebb, all things
ere now would have been dissolved and changed into air. It therefore
ceases not to be begotten from things and to go back again into things,
since it is a fact that all things constantly ebb.

Likewise the abundant source of clear light, the ethereal sun, con-
stantly floods heaven with fresh brightness and replaces on the instant
light by new light3 for every previous emission of brightness 13 quite
lost, wherever it falls. This you may know from the following examples:
