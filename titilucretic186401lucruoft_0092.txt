80 ⁸ II

omnis enim per se divom natura necessest
inmortali aevo summa cum pace fruatur
semota ab antris rebus seiunctaque longe3
nam privata dolore omni, privata pericliS,
ipsa suis pollens opibUS, nil indiga nostri, 650
nec bene promeritis capitur neque tangitur ira.
65 5 hic siquis mare Neptunum Cereremque vocare
constituit fruges et Bacchi nomine abuti
mavolt quam laticis proprium proferre vocamen,
concedamus ut hic terrarum dictitet orbem 65 5
esse deum matrem, dum vera re tamen ipse
680 religione animum turpi contingere parcat.
652 terra quidem vero caret omni tempore sensu,
et quia multarum potitur primordia rerum,
multa modis multis effert in lumina 30113. 660
660 Saepe itaque ex uno tondentes gramina campo
lanigerae pecudes et equorum duellica proles
buceriaeque greges eodem sub tegmine caeli
ex unoque sitim sedantes flumine aquai
dissimili vivont specie retinentque parentum 665
665 naturam et mores generatim quaeque imitantur.
tanta est in quovis genere herbae materiai
dissimilis rati0‚ tanta est in flumine quoque.

true reason. For the nature of gods must ever in itself of necessity
enjoy immortality together with supreme repose, far removed and with-
drawn from our concerns 3 for exempt from every pain, exempt from all
dangem, strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of 113, it is
neither gained by favours nor moved by anger. And here if any one
thinks proper to call the sea Neptune and corn Ceres and chooses rather
to misuse the name of Bacchus than to utter the term that belongs to
that liquor, let us allow him to declare that the earth is mother of*
the godS, if he only forbear in earnest to stain 1113 mind with foul
religion. The earth however is at all time without feeling, and because it
receives into it the first-beginnings of many things, it brings them forth
in many ways into4the light of the sun.

And so the wodly flocks and the martial breed of horses and horned
herds, though often cropping the grass from one field beneath the same
canopy of heaven and slaking their thirst from one stream of water, yet
have all their life a dissimilar appearance and retain the nature of their
parents and severally imitate their ways each after its kind: so great is
the diversity of matter in any kind of herbage‚ so great in every river.
