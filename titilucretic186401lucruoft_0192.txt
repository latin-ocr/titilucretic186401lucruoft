at simulacra viis derectis omnia tendunt

saepem ultra potis est, at voces accipere extra.
et tamen ipsa quoque haec, dum transit clausa domorum,
vox optunditur atque auris confusa penetrat
et sonitum potius quam verba audire videmur.
Nec, qui sentimus sucum, lingua atque palatum 615
plusculum habent in se rationis plus operaeve.
principio sucum sentimus in ore, cibum cum
mandendo exprimimus, ceu plenam spongiam aquai

In the first place we perceive flavour in the mouth when we press it out
in chewing our food, in the same way as when one haply begins to
squeeze with his hand and dry a sponge full of water. Next the whole
of what we press out distributes itself through the cavities of the palate
and the intricate openings of the porous tqngue. Therefore when the
bodies of oozing flavour are smooth, they pleasantly touch and pleasantly

<k feel all the parts about the moist exuding quarters of the palm But

on the other hand when they are gathered in a mass they puncture and

tear the sense according to the degree' 111 which they are pervaded by
roughness. N ext the pleasure from the flavour reaches as far as the
