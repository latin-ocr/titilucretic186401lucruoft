alterutrum fatearis enim sumasque necessest.
quorum utrumque tibi effugium praecludit et omne 975
cogit ut exempta concedas fine patere.
nam sive est aliquit quod probeat officiatque
quominu’ quo missum est veniat finique locet se,
sive foras fertur, non est a fine profectum.
hoc pacto sequar atque, oras ubicumque locaris 980

that the universe stretches without end. For whether there is some-
thing to get in its way and prevent its coming whither it was sent and
placing itself in the point intended, or whether it is carried forward, in
either 0330 it has not started from the end. In this way I will go on
and, wherever you have placed the outside borders, I will ask what then
becomes of the javelin. The result will be that an end can nowhere be
fixed, and that the room given for fiight will still prolong 1110· power of
flight. Lastly one thing is seen by the eyes to end another thing3 air
bounds off 111113, and mountains air, earth limits sea and sea again all
lands ; the universe however there is nothing outside to end.

Again if all the space of the whole sum were enclosed within fixed
borders and were bounded, in that case the store of matter by its solid
weights would have streamed together from all sides to the lowest point
nor could anything have gone on under the canopy of heaven, no nor
would there have been a heaven nor sunlight at all, inasmuch as all
matter, settling down through infinite time past, would lie together in a
heap. But as it is, sure enough no rest is given to the bodies of the
