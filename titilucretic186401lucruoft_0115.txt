tillage of the fields; so niggardly are they of their produce and after so
‘much labour do they let them grow. And now the aged ploughman
shakes his head and sighs again and again to think that *the labours of
his hand. have come to nothingj, and when he compares present times

plot of ground, since the allotment of land to each man was far less of

shrivelled vine impeaches the march of time and wearies heaven, and
comprehends not that all things are gradually wasting away and passing

to the grave, qm’te forespent by age and vlength of dayS.
