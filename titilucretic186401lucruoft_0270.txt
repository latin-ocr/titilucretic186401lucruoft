different meanings 2 since dumb brutes, yes and the races of wild-beasts
are accustomed to give forth distinct and varied soundS, when they have
fear or pain and when joys are rife. This you may learn from facts plain
to sense: when the large spongy opened lips of Molossian dogs begin to
growl enraged and bare their hard teeth‚ thus drawn back in rage they
