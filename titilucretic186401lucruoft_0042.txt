coerS, nil ab se quod possit mittere raptim3
aestifer ignis uti lumen iacit atque vaporem,
ut videas non e stipatis partibus esse.
quod si forte alia credunt ratione potesse 665
ignis in coetu stingui mutareque corPUS,
scilicet ex nulla facere id si parte reparcent,
occidet ad nilum nimirum funditus ardor
omnis et e nilo fient quaecumque creantur.
nam quodcumque suis mutatum finib‘Ys exit, 670
continuo hoc mors est illius quod fuit ante.
proinde aliquit superare necesse est incolume ollis,
ne tibi res redeant ad nilum funditus omnes
de niloque renata vigescat copia rerum.
nunc igitur quoniam certissima corpora quaedam 675
sunt quae conservant naturam semper eandem,
quorum abitu aut aditu mutatoque ordine mutant
naturam res et convertunt corpora sese,
scire licet non esse haec ignea corpora rerum.
nil referret enim quaedam decedere abire, 680
atque alia adtribui, mutarique ordine quaedam,
si tamen ardoris naturam cuncta tenerent 3
ignis enim foret omnimodis quodcumque crearent.

which cannot briskly radiate anything from it, in the way beat-giving
fire emits light and warmth, letting you see that it is not of closely com-
pressed parts. But if they haply think that in some other way fires
may be quenched in the union and change their body you are to know
that if they shall scruple on no side to do this, all heat sure enough will
,be utterly brought to nothing, and all things that are produced will be
formed out of nothing. For whenever a thing changes and quits its
proper limits, at once this change of state is the death of that which
was before. Therefore something or other must needs be left to those
fires of theirs undestroyed, that you may not have all things absolutely
returning to nothing, and the whole store of things born anew and
flourishing out of nothing. Since then in fact there are some most
unquestionable bodies which always preserve the same nature, on whose
going or coming or change of order things change their nature 'and
bodies are transformed, you are to know that these first bodies of things
are not of fire. For it would matter nothing that some should withdraw
and go away and others should be added on and some should have their
order changed, if they yet one and all retained the nature of heat 3 for
whatever they produced would be altogether fire. But thus methinks it is ι
