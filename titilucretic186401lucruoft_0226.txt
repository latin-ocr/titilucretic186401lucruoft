sed simulacra solere in somnis fallere mentem,

cernere cum videamur eum quem vita reliquit,

quod superest, nunc huc rationis detulit ordo, ‚

ut mihi mortali consistere corpore mundum 65
nativomque simul ratio reddunda sit esse3

et quibus ille modis congressus materiai

fundarit terram caelum mare sidera solem

lunaique globum; tum quae tellure animantes

extiterint, et quae nullo sint tempore natae; 70
quove modo genus humanum variante loquella

coeperit inter se vesci per nomina rerum3

si tamen interea mirantur qua ratione

quaeque geri possint, praesertim rebus in illis

well as those which never at any time were born 3 in what way too man-
kind began to use with one another varied speech by the names con-
ferred on things, and also in what ways yon sear of the gods gained an
entry into men's breasts, and now throughout the world maintains as
holy sanes lakes groves altars and idols of the gods. Furthermore I
shall make clear by what force piloting nature guides the courses of the
sun and the wanderings of the moon 3 lest haply we imagine that these
of their own free will between heaven and earth traverse their everlast-
ing orbits, graciously furthering the increase of crops and living creatures,
or think they roll on by any forethought of the gods. For they wh'o
have been rightly taught that the gods lead a life without care, if
nevertheless they wonder by what plan all things can be carried on,
above all in regard to those things which are seen overhead in the
