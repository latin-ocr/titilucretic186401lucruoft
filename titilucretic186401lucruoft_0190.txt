the ears, stamping upon them the form anddistinct sound of the word.
But such of the voices as do not fall directly on the ears, are carried past
and lost, fruitlessly dispersed in air: some striking upon solid spots are
thrown back and give back a sound and semetimes mock by an echo of
the word. Now that you fully perceive all this, you may explain to
yourself and others how it is that in lonely spots rocks give back in
regular succession forms of words like to those sent forth, when we seek
our comrades straying about among the darkened hills and with loud
voice call upon them scattered abroad. I have seen places give back as
many as six or seven voices, when you sent forth one ε in such wise did
the very hills dash back on hills and repeat the words thus trained to
come back. These spots the people round fancy that the goat-footed
satyrs and nymphs inhabit, and tell that they are the fauns by whose night-
