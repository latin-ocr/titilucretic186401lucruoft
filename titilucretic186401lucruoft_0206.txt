tum nobis animam perturbatam esse putandumst
eiectamque foras; non omnem; namque iaceret
aeterno corpus perfusum> frigore leti.

quippe ubi nulla latens animai pars remaneret 925
in membriS, cinere ut multa latet obrutus igniS‚

unde reconflari sensus per membra repente

posset, ut ex igni caeco consurgere flamma?

Sed quibus haec rebus novitas confiat et unde
perturbari anima et corpus languescere possit, 930
expediam: tu fac ne ventis verba profundam.
principio externa corpus de parte necessum est,
aeriis quoniam vicinum tangitur auriS,

ordered and forced abroad 3 not indeed all3 for then the body would lie
steeped in the everlasting chill of death. Where no part of the soul
remained behind concealed in the limbs, as fire remains concealed when
buried under much asli, whence could sense be suddenly rekindled
through the linibs, as fiame can spring up from hidden fire ‘l

But by what means this change of condition is accomplished and
from what the sou] can be disordered and the body grow faint, I will
explain ε do you mind that I waste not my words on the wind. In the
first place the body in its outer side, since it is next to and is touched
by the air, must be thumped and beaten by its repeated blows3 and
for this reason all things as a rule are covered either by a hide
or else by shells or by a callous skin or by bark. When creatures
breathe‚ this air at the same time buffets the inner side also, as it is
inhaled and exhaled. Therefore since the body is beaten on both sides
alike and blows arrive by means of the small apertures at the primal
parts and primal elements of our body, there gradually ensues a sort of
breaking up throughout our limbs, the arrangements of the first-begin-
nings of body and mind being disordered. Then next a part of the soul
