dissolui quo quaeque supremo tempore possint,

materies ut subpeditet rebus reparandis,

sunt igitur solida primordia simplicitate

nec ratione queunt alia servata per aevom

ex infinito iam tempore res reparare. 550
Denique si nullam finem natura parasset

frangendis rebUS, iam corpora materiai

usque redacta forent aevo frangente priore,

ut nil ex illis a certo tempore posset

conceptum summum aetatis pervadere ad auctum. 5 5 5
nam quidvis citius dissolvi posse videmus

quam rursus refici3 quapropter longa diei

infinita aetas anteacti temporis omnis

quod fregisset adhuc disturbans dissoluensque‚

numquam relicuo reparari tempore posset. 560
at nunc nimirum frangendi reddita finis

certa manet, quoniam refici rem quamque videmus

et finita simul generatim tempora rebus

stare, quibus possint aevi contingere florem.

huc accedit uti, solidissima materiai 565
corpora cum constant, possit tamen, omnia, reddi,
mollia quae fiunt, aer aqua terra vaporeS‚

quo pacto fiant et qua vi quaeque gerantur,

all things can be dissolved at their last hour, that there may be a
supply of matter for the reproduction of things. Therefore first-be-
ginnings are of solid singleness, and in no other way can they have
⁴ been preserved through ages during infinite time past in order to re-
produce things.

Again if nature had set no limit to the breaking of things, by this
time the bodies of matter would have been so far reduced by the break-
ing of past ages that nothing could within a fixed time be conceived out
of them and reach its utmost growth of being. For we see that any—
thing is more quickly destroyed than again renewed 3 and therefore that
which the long, the infinite duration of all bygone time had broken up
demolished and destroyed, could never be reproduced in all remaining
time. But now sure enough a fixed limit to their breaking has been
set, since we see each thing renewed, and at the same time definite
periods fixed for things to reach the flower of their age. Moreover
while the bodies of matter are most solid, it may yet be explained in
what way all things which are formed soft, as air water earth fires, are
so formed and by what force they severally go on, since once for all
