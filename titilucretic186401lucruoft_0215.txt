nequiquam, quoniam medio de fonte leporum

surgit amari aliquit quod in ipsis floribus angat,

aut cum conscius ipse animus se forte remordet 1135

desidiose agere aetatem lustrisque perire,

aut quod in ambiguo verbum iaculata reliquit

quod cupido adfixum cordi vivescit ut igniS‚

aut nimium iactare oculos aliumve tueri

because she has launched forth some word and left its meaning in doubt
and it cleaves 130 the love-sick heart and burns like living fire, or because

it fancies she casts her eyes too freely about or looks on another, and it
sees in her face traces of a smile.

And these evils are found in 10176 returned and highly prosperous 3
but in crossed and hopeless love are ills such as you may seize with
closed eyes, past numbering 3 80 that it is better 130 watch beforehand in
the manner I have prescribed, and be on your guard not to be drawn in.
For to avoid falling into the 130118 of love is not 80 hard aS, after you are
caught, 130 get out of the nets you are in and to break through the strong
meshes of Venus. And yet even when you are entangled and held fast
you may escape the mischief, unless you stand in your own way and
begin by overlooking all the defects of her mind or those of her body,
whoever it is whom you court and woo. For this men usually do,
