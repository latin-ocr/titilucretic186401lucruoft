116111 si tanto operest animi mutata potestaS‚

omnis ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum, 675

non, ut opinor, id a leto iam longiter errat3

quapropter fateare necessest quae fuit ante

interiisse et quae nunc est nunc esse creatam.

Praeterea si iam perfecto corpore nobis

inferri solitast animi vivata potestas 680

tum cum gignimur et vitae cum limen inimUS,

haud ita conveniebat uti cum corpore et una

cum membris videatur in ipso sanguine cresse,

sed velut in cavea per se sibi vivere solam.

OONVENIT Ur SENsU CORPUS TAMEN AFFLUAT OMNE 685
690 quod fieri totum contra manifesta docet res 3

namque ita conexa est per venas viscera nervos

ossaque, uti dentes quoque sensu participentur;

morsus ut indicat et gelidai stringor aquai

et lapis oppmssm, subiit si 6 frugibua asper. 690

If the power of the mind has been so completely changed, that all re-
membrance of past things is lost, that methinks differs not widely from
death3 therefore you must admit that the soul which was before has
perished and that which now is has now been formed.

Again if the quickened power of the mind is wont to be put into us
after our body is fully formed, at the instant of our birth and our crossing
the threshold of life, it ought agreeably to this to live not in such a way
as to seem to have grown with the body and together with its members
within the blood, but 111 6 01611 apart to and by itself: the very contrary
to what undoubted fact teaches 3 for it is so closely united with the body
throughout the veins flesh sinews and bones, that the very teeth have a
share of sense ; as the act of biting proves and the sharp twinge of cold
water and the crunching of a rough stone, when it has got into them
out of bread. Wherefore, again and again Ι say, we must believe souls
to be neither without a birth nor exempted from the law of death 3 for
we must not believe that they could have been so completely united
with our bodies, if they found their way into them from without, nor,
since they are so closely inwoven with them, does it appear that they
