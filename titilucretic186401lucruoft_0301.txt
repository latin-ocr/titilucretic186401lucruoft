VI 289

perscindit subito nubem, ferturque coruscis

omnia luminibus lustrans loca percitus ardor.

quem gravis insequitur sonituS, displosa repente 285
opprimere ut caeli videatur templa superne.

inde tremor terras graviter pertemptat et altum
murmura percurrunt caelum3 nam tota fere tum
tempestas concussa tremit fremitusque moventur.

quo de concussu sequitur gravis imber et uber, 290
omnis uti videatur in imbrem vertier aether

atque ita praecipitans ad diluviem revocari:

tantus discidio nubis ventique-⁷ procella

mittitur, ardenti sonitus 011111 provolat ictu.

est etiam cum vis extrinsecus incita venti 295
incidit in calidam maturo fulmine nubem3

quam cum perscidit, extemplo cadit igneus ille

vertex quem patrio vocitamus nomine fulmen.

hoc fit idem in partis 31138, quocumque tulit vis

fit quoque ut interdum venti vis missa sine igni 300
igniscat tamen in spatio longoque meatn,

dum venit, amittens in cursu corpora quaedam

grandia quae nequeunt pariter penetrare per auras ;
atque alia ex ipso conradens aere portat

and their heat put in motion is carried 011 traversing 311 ρ13008 with
flashing lights. Close upon it follows so heavy a clap that it seems to
crush down from above the quarters of heaven which have suddenly
sprung asunder. Then a trembling violently seizes the earth and rum-
blings run through the sky 3 for the whole body of the storm then with-
out exception quakes with the shock and loud roarings are aroused.
After this shock follows so heavy and copious 3 13111 that the whole
ether seems to be turning into rain and then to be tumbling down and
returning to 3 deluge: so great a flood of it is discharged by the bursting
of the cloud and the storm of wind, when the sound flies forth fr0m the
burning stroke. At times too the force of the wind aroused from with-
out falls 011 3 cloud hot with a fully forged thunderbolt 3 and when it
has burst it, forthwith there falls down yon fiery eddying whirl which in
our native speech we call a thunderbolt. The same takes place on every
other side towards which the force in question has borne down. Some-
times too the power of the wind though discharged without fire, yet
catches fire in the course of its long travel, and while it is passing on, it
loses on the way some large bodies which cannot like the rest get
through the air, and gathers together out of the air itself and carries
