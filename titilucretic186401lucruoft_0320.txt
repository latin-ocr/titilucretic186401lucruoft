non satis est, verum pluriS, unde una tamen sit3 ·
corpus ut exanimum siquod procul ipse iacere 705
conspicias hominis, fit ut omnis dicere causas
conveniat leti, dicatur ut illius una.
nam neque eum ferro nec frigore vincere possis
interiisse neque a morbo neque forte venene,
verum aliquid genere esse ex hoc quod contigit ei 710
scimus, item in multis hoc rebus dicere habemus

Nilus in aestatem crescit campisque redundat,
unicus in terris Aegypti totius 61111113.

13 rigat Aegyptum medium per saepe calorem,

aut quia sunt aestate aquilones ostia contra, 715
anni tempore eo qui etesiae esse feruntur,

et contra fluvium flantes remorantur et undas

cogentes sursus replent coguntque manere.

nam dubio procul haec adverso flabra feruntur

flumine, quae gelidis ab stellis axis aguntur. 720
ille ex aestifera parti venit amnis ab austro,

inter nigra virum percocto saecla colore

exoriens penitus media ab regione diei.

est quoque uti possit magnus congestus harenae
fluctibus adversis oppilare ostia contra, 725

cause 3 you must give several, one of which at the same time is the real
cause. For instance should you 366 the lifeless body of a man lying at

death, in order that the one real cause of that man's death be mentioned
among them. Thus you may be able to prove that he has not died by
steel or cold or from disease or haply frOm poison 3 yet we know that 11
13 something of this kind which has befallen him 3 and so in many other
cases we may make the same remark.

The Nile rises in summer and overflows the plains, that one sole
river throughout the whole land of Egypt. It waters Egypt often in
the middle of the hot season, either because in summer there are north
winds opposite its mouthS‚ which at that time of year go by the name of
Etesian winds. Blowing up the river they retard it and driving the
waters backwards fill the charmel full and force the waters to stand
still3 sor beyond a doubt these blasts which start from the icy constel-
lations of the pole are carried right up the stream. That river comes
from the south out of the beat-fraught country, rising far up from the
central region of day among races of men black in their sun-baked com-
plexion. 1113 quite possible too that the great accumulation of sand
may bar up the mouths right across against the descending 6111161113,
