¹ nam certe ex vivo Centauri non fit image,
nulla fuit quoniam talis natura animantis ; 740
verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,
haerescit facile extempIO, quod diximus ante,
propter subtilem naturam et tenvia texta.
cetera de genere hoc eadem ratione creantur.
quae cum mobiliter summa levitate feruntur, 745
ut prius ostendi, facile uno. commovet ictu
quaelibet una animum nobis subtilis imago;
tenvis enim mens est et mire mobilis ipsa.

Haec fieri ut memore, facile hinc cognoscere possis,
quatenus hoc simile est illi, quod mente videmus 750
atque oculis, simili fieri ratione necesse est.
nunc igitur docui quoniam me forte leonem
cernere per simulacra, oculos quaecumque lacessunt,
scire licet mentem simili ratione moveri,
per simulacra leonem et cetera quae videt aeque 755
nec minus atque oculi, nisi quod mage tenvia cernit.
nec ratione alia, cum somnus membra profudit,
mens animi vigilat, nisi quod simulacra lacessunt
haec eadem nostros animos quae cum vigilamUS,
usque ade0‚ certe ut videamur cernere eum quem 760

Centaur is formed out of a live one, since no such nature of living
creature ever existed3 but when images of a horse and a man have by
chance come together, they readily adhere at once, as we said before, on
account of their fine nature and thin texture. All other things ‘of the
kind are produced in like fashion. And when these from extreme
lightness are borne on with velocity, as I shewed before, any one com-
posite image you like moves the mind by a single stroke 3 for the mind
is fine and is itself wondrously nimble.

- That all this is done as I relate you may easily learn from what
follows. So far as the one result is like the other, that which we see
with the mind and with the eyes, must be produced in a like way.
Well then since I have shewn that Ι perceive for instance a lion by
’ῗ means of idols which provoke the eyes, you may be sure that the mind
ξ is moved in a like way, which by means of idols sees a lion or anything
² else just as well as the eyes, with this difference that it perceives much
, thinner idols. And when sleep has prostrated the body, for no other
reason does the mind's intelligence wake, except because the very same
idols provoke our minds which provoke them when we are awake, and
to such av degree that we seem without a doubt to perceive him whom
