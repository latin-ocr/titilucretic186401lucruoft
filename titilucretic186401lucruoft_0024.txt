111001111111 remanent res corpore, dum satis 30113

vis obeat pro textura cuiusque reperta.
haud igitur redit ad nilum res ulla, sed omnes

discidio redeunt in corpora materiai.
postremo pereunt 111111163, ubi eos pater aether 250
in gremium matris terrai praecipitavit3
at nitidae surgunt fruges ramique virescunt
arboribus, 0163011111 ipsae fetuque gravantur3

111110 136133 urbes pueris florere videmus 255
frondiferasque novis avibus canere undique silvas;
hinc fessae pecudes pingui per pabula laeta
corpora deponunt et candens lacteus umor

Nunc age, res quoniam docui non posse creari 265

them sufficiently strong to overpower the texture of each. A thing
therefore never returns to nothing, but all things after disruption go
back into the first bodies of matter. Lastly rains die, when father
ether has tumbled them into the lap of mother earth 3 but then goodly
crops spring up and boughs are green with leaves upon the trees, trees
themselves grow and are laden with fruit 3 by them in turn our race and
the race of wild-beasts are fed, by them we see glad towns teem with
children and the leafy forests ring on all sides with the song of new
birds 3 through them cattle wearied with their load of fat lay their
bodies down about the glad pastures and the white milky stream pours
from the distended udders3 through them a new brood with weakly
limbs frisks and gambols over the soft grass, their' young minds smitten
with the love of new milk. N one of the things therefore which seem
to be lost is utterly lost, since nature replenishes one thing out of
another and does 'not suffer any thing to be begotten, before she has
been recruited by the death of some other.

Now mark me: since I have taught that things cannot be born from
nothing, cannot when begotten be brought back to nothing, that you
