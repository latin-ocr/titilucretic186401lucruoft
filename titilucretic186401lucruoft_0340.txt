sanguine et ulceribus vocis via saepta coibat
atque animi interpres manabat lingua cruore

debilitata maliS‚ motu graviS, aspera tactu. 1150
inde ubi per fauces pectus complerat et ipsum

morbida vis in cor maestum confluxerat aegriS,

omnia tum vero vitai claustra lababant.

spiritus ore foras taetrum volvebat odorem,

rancida quo perolent proiecta cadavera ritu, 1155
atque animi prorsum tum vires totius, omne

languebat corpus leti iam limine in ipso,
intolerabilibusque malis erat anxius angor

adsidue comes et gemitu commixta querella.

would all the barriers of life give way. The breath ⁸would pour out at
the mouth a noisome stench‚ even as the stench of rotting carcasses
thrown out unburied. And then the powers of the entire mind, the
whole body would sink utterly, now on the very threshold of death.
And a bitter bitter despondency was the constant attendant on insuffer-
able ills and complaining mingled with moaning. An ever-recurring
hiccup often the night and day through, forcing on continual spasms in
sinews and limbs‚ would break men quite, forwearying those forspent
before. And yet in none could you perceive the skin on the sur-face of
the body burn with any great heat, but the body would rather offer to
the hand a lukewarm sensation and at the same time be red all over with
ulcers burnt into it so to speak, as happens when the holy fire is spread-

to the very boneS‚ a flame would burn within the stomach as within
furnaceS. Nothing was light and thin enough to apply to the relief of
