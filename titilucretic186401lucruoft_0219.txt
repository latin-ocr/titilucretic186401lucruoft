fit quoque ut interdum similes existere avorum
possint et referant proavorum saepe figuras
propterea quia multa modis primordia multis 1220
mixta suo celant in corpore saepe parentiS‚
quae patribus patres tradunt ab stirpe profecta ;
inde Venus varia producit sorte figuras
maiorumque refert voltus vocesque comasque.
1227 et muliebre oritur patrio de semine saeclum 1225
maternoque mares existunt corpore creti3

body 3 since these distinctions no more proceed from the fixed seed of
one or other parent than our faces and bodies and limbs: the birth is
always formed out of the two seeds3 and whichever parent that which

Nor do the divine powers debar anybody from the power of be-
getting‚ forbidding him ever to receive the name of father from sweet
children and forcing him to pass his life in a barren wedlock3 as men
