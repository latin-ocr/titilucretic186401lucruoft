quare etiam atque etiam procul est ut credere possis
utilitatis ob officium potuisse creari]
[Illud item non est mirandum, corporis ipsa
quod natura cibum quaerit cuiusque animantis.
quippe etenim fluere atque recedere corpora rebus 860
multa modis multis docui, sed plurima debent
ex animalibus quae quia sunt exercita motu,
multaque per sudorem ex alto pressa feruntur,
multa per os exhalantur, cum languida anhelant,

again and again Ι repeat, it is quite impossible to believe that they could
have been made for the duties which they discharge.

It ought likewise to cause no wonder that the nature of the body of
each living creature absolutely requires food. I have shewn that bodies
ebb away and withdraw from things, many in number in many ways 3
but most numerous must be those which withdraw from living things ς
for because these are tried by active motion, and many particles are
pressed out from the depths of the frame and carried off by sweating,
many breathed out through the mouth, when they pant from exhaustion,
from such causes the body becomes rarefied and the whole nature under-
mined ; and this state is attended by pain. Food therefore is taken in
order to give support to the frame and recruit the strength by its in-
fusion, and to close up the open-mouthed craving for meat throughout
limbs and veins. The moisture too passes into all the parts which call
for moisture 3 and many accumulated bodies of heat which cause a
burning in our body, the approach of liquid scatters and quenches as if
they were fire, so that dry heat can no longer parch the frame. In
this way then you see gasping thirst is drenched out of our body, in this
way the hungry craving is satisfied.

Now how it comes to pass that we are able to step out when we
