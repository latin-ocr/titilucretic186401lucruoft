Ι 9

tuto res teneras effert in luminis oras?

quod si de nilo fierent, subito exorerentur 180
incerto spatio atque alienis partibus anni,

quippe ubi nulla forent primordia quae genitali

concilio possent arceri tempore iniquo.

nec porro augendis rebus spatio foret usus

seminis ad coitum, si e nilo crescere possent; 185
nam fierent iuvenes subito ex infantibu' parvis

e terraque exorta repente arbusta salirent.

quorum nil fieri manifestum est, omnia quando
paulatim crescunt, ut par est, semine certo

crescentesque genus servant3 ut noscere possis 190
quicque sua de materia grandescere alique.

huc accedit uti sine certis imbribus anni

laetificos nequeat fetus submittere tellus

nec porro secreta cibo natura animantum

propagare genus possit vitamque tueri3 195
ut potius multis communia corpora rebus

multa putes esse, ut verbis elementa videmUS,

quam sine principiis ullam rem existere posse.

denique cur homines tantos natura parare

non potuit, pedibus qui pontum per vada possent 200

light't But if they came from nothing, they would rise up suddenly
at uncertain periods and unsuitable times of year, inasmuch as there
would be no first-beginnings which might be kept from a begetting
union by the unpropitious season. No nor would time be required for
the growth of things after the meeting of the seed, if they could increase
out of nothing. Little ‘babies would at once grow into men and trees
in a moment would rise and start out of the ground. But none of these
events it is plain ever comes to pass, since all things grow step by step,
as is natural, [since they all grow] from a fixed seed and in growing
preserve their kind 3 so that you may be sure that all things increase
in size and are fed out of their own matter. Furthermore without fixed
seasons of rain the earth is unable to put forth its gladdening produce,
nor again if kept from food could the nature of living things continue
its kind and sustain life 3 so that you might hold with greater truth
that many bodies are common to many things, as we see letters common
to different words, than that any thing could come into being without
first-beginnings. Again why could not nature have produced men of
such a size and strength as to be able to wade on foot across the sea
