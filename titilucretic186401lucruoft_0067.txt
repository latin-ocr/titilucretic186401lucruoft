nam quoniam per inane vagantur, cuncta necessest

aut gravitate sua ferri primordia rerum

aut ictu forte alterius. nam cum cita saepe 85
obvia conflixere, fit ut diversa repente

dissiliant3 neque enim mirum, durissima quae sint
ponderibus solidis neque quicquam a tergo ibus obstet.
et quo iactari magis omnia materiai

corpora pervideaS, reminiscere totius imum 90
nil esse in summa, neque habere ubi corpora prima
consistant, quoniam spatium sine fine modoquest
inmensumque patere in cunctas undique partis

pluribus ostendi et certa ratione probatumst.

quod quoniam constat, nimirum nulla quies est 95
reddita corporibus primis per inane profundum,

sed magis adsiduo varioque exercita motu

exiguis intervallis convecta resultant,

haec validas saxi radices et fera ferri
corpora constituunt et cetera de genere horum.

of true reason: since they travel about through void, the first-beginnings
of things must all move on either by their own weight or haply by the
stroke of another. For when during motion they have, as often happens,
met and clashed, the result is a sudden rebounding in an opposite direc-
tion3 and no wonder, since they are most hard and of weight propor-
tioned to their solidity and nothing behind gets in their way. And
that you may more clearly see that all bodies of matter are in restless
movement, remember that there is no lowest point in the sum of the
universe, and that first bodies have not where to take their stand, since
space is without end and limit and extends immeasurably in all direc-
tions round, as I have shewn in many words and as has been proved by
sure reason. Since this then is a certain truth, sure enough no rest is
given to first bodies throughout the unfathomable void, but driven on
rather in ceaseless and varied motion they partly, after they have pressed
together, rebound leaving great spaces between, while in part they are
so dashed away after the stroke as to leave but small spaces between.
And all that form a denser aggregation when brought together and re-
bound leaving trifling spaces between, held fast by their own close-tangled
shapes, these form enduring bases of stone and unyielding bodies of iron
