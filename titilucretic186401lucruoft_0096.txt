corpora consimili sint eius tincta colore.
nullus enim color est omnino materiai
corporibus, neque par rebus neque denique dispar.
in quae corpora si nullus tibi forte videtur
posse animi iniectus fieri, procul avius erras, 740
nam cum caecigeni, solis qui lumina numquam
dispexere, tamen cognoscant corpora tactu,
744 scire licet nostrae quoque menti corpora posse
vorti in notitiam nullo circumlita fuco,

denique nos ipsi caecis quaecumque tenebris 745
tangimUS, haud ullo sentimus tincta colore.
quod quoniam vinco fieri, nunc esse docebo
743 ex ineunte aevo nullo coniuncta colore.

quod facere haud ullo debent primordia pacto; 750
immutabile enim quiddam superare necessest,
ne res ad nilum redigantur funditus omnes,
nam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,
continuo hoc mors est illius quod fuit ante.
proinde colore cave contingas semina rerum, 755

matter are dyed with a colour like to it. For there is no colour at all
to the bodies of matter, either like to the things 01 unlike. But if
haply it seems to you that no impression of the mind 0011 throw itself
into these bodies, you wander far asti-ay. For since men born blind
who have never beheld the light of the sun, do yet know bodies
by touch, you are to know that bodies can fall under the ken of our
mind too, though stained with no colour. Again whatever things we
ourselves touch in the thick darkness, we do not perceive to be dyed with
any colour. And since I prove that this is the case, I will now shew
that there are things linked to no colour from the beginning of time.
Well any colour without any exception changes into any other ; and
this first-beginnings ought 111 110 wise to do: something unchangeable
must remain over, that all things be not utterly reduced to nothing. Ι
For whenever a thing changes and quits its proper limits, at once
this change of state is the death of that which was before. Therefore
mind not to dye with colour the seeds of things that you may not have'
all things altogether returning to nothing.

Moreover if no quality of colom· is assigned to first-beginnings and
they are yet possessed of varied shapes out of which they beget colours
