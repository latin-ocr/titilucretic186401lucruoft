ponderibus propriis incerto tempore ferme
incertisque loci spatiis decellere paulum,
tantum quod momen mutatum dicere possis, 220
quod nisi declinare solerent, omnia deorsum,
imbris uti guttae, caderent per inane profundum,
nec foret offensus natus nec plaga creata
principiis: ita nil umquam natura creasset.
Quod si forte aliquis credit graviora potesse 225
corpora, quo citius rec-tum per inane feruntur,
incidere ex supero levioribus atque ita plagas
gignere quae possint genitalis reddere motUS‚
avius a vera longe ratione recedit.
nam per aquas quaecumque cadunt atque aera rarum, 230
haec pro ponderibus casus celerare necessest
propterea quia corpus aquae naturaque tenvis
aeris haut possunt aeque rem quamque morari,
sed citius cedunt gravioribus exsuperata 3
at contra nulli de nulla parte neque ullo 235
tempore inane potest vacuum subsistere rei,
quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat3
omnia quapropter debent per inane quietum
aeque ponderibus non aequis concita ferri.
haud igitur poterunt levioribus incidere umquam 240

uncertain points of space they swerve a little from their equal poise:
you just aud only just can call it a change of inclination. If they
were not used to swerve, they all would fall down, like drops of rain,
through the deep void, and no clashing would have been begotten, nor
blow produced among the first-beginnings: thus nature never would
have produced aught.

But if haply any one believes that heavier bodieS‚ as they are carried
more quickly she-er through space, can fall from above on the lighter and
so· beget blows able to produce begetting motions, he goes most widely
astray from true reason. For whenever bodies fall through water and
thin air, they must quicken their descents in proportion to their weights,
because the body of water and subtle nature of air cannot retard every-
thing in equal degree, but more readily give way, overpowered by the
heavier: on the other hand empty void cannot offer resistance to any-
thing 111 any direction at any time, but must, as its nature craves, con-
tinually give way, and for this reason all things must be moved and

borne along with equa] velocitxjhough of 1111911311 weights through. the
unresistingw void Therefore heavier things will never be able to fall
