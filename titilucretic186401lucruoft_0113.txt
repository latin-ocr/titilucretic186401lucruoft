’ἰ 01111113 perduxit rerum natura creatrix3
ut fit ubi nilo iam plus est quod datur intra
vitalis venas quam quod fluit adque recedit.

hic natura suis refrenat viribus auctum.
nam quaecumque vides hilaro grandescere adauctu
paulatimque gradus aetatis scandere adultae,
plura sibi adsumunt quam de se corpora mittunt,

nam certe fluere adque recedere corpora rebus
multa manus dandum est3 sed plura accedere debent,

is no more than that which ebbs from them and withdraws: at this
point the life-growth in all things must stop, at this point nature
by her powers checks further increase. For whatever things you see
grow in size with joyous increase and mount by successive steps to
mature age, take to themselves more bodies than they discharge from
themselves, while food is readily infused into all the arteries and the
things are not so widely spread out as to throw off many particles and
<oggasioii more waste than their age cah take in as nourishment. For no
doubt it must be conceded that many bodies ebb away and withdraw
from things ; but still more must join them, until they have touched the
utmost point of growth. Then piece by piece age breaks their powers and
matured strength and wastes away 011 the side of decay. For the larger
⁴ a thing is and the wider, as soon as its growth is stopped, at once it
sheds abroad and discharges from it more bodies in all directions round 5
and its food is not readily transmitted into all its arteries and is not
enough, in proportion to the copious exhalations which the thing throws
off, to enable a like amount to rise up and be supplied. For food must
