nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam

naturam rerum 3 tanta stat praedita culpa.

principio quantum caeli tegit impetus ingenS‚ 200
inde avidei partem montes silvaeque ferarum

possedere, tenent rupes vastaeque paludes

et mare quod late terrarum distinet oras,

inde duas porro prope partis fervidus ardor

adsiduusque geli casus mortalibus aufert. 205
quod superest arvi, tamen id natura sua vi

sentibus obducat, ni vis humana resistat

vitai causa valido consueta bidenti

ingemere et terram pressis proscindere aratris,

si non fecundas vertentes vomere glebas 210
terraique solum subigentes cimus ad ortUS,

sponte sua nequeant liquidas existere in 311138,

cum iam per terras frondent atque omnia florent,

aut nimiis torret fervoribus aetherius sol Α 215
31113 subiti peremunt imbris gelidaeque pruinae,
flabraque ventorum violento turbine vexant.

praeterea genus horriferum natura ferarum

humanae genti infestum terraque marique

by no means been made for us by divine power: so great are the defects
with which it is encumbered. In the first place of all the space which
the vast reach of heaven covers, a portion greedy mountains and forests
of wild-beasts have occupied, rocks and wasteful pools take up and the
sea which holds wide apart the coasts of different lands. Next of
nearly two thirds burning heat and the constant fall of frost rob mortals.
What is left for tillage‚ even that nature by its power would overrun
with thorns, unless the force of man made head against it, accustomed
for the sake of a livelihood to groan beneath the strong hoe and to cut
through the earth by pressing down 13116 plough. Unless by turning up
the fruitful clods with the share and labouring the soil of the earth we
stimulate things to rise, they could not spontaneously come up into
the clear air 3 and even then sometimes when things earned with
great toil now put forth their leaves over the earth and are all in
blossom, either the ethereal sun burns them up with excessivo heats
or sudden showers and cold frosts cut them off, and the blasts of the
winds waste them by a furious hurricane. Again why does nature give
food and increase to the frightful race of wild-beasts dangerous to man-
