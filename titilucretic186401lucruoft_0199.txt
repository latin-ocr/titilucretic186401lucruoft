rellicta vita iam mors et terra potitast.
hoc ideo fieri cogit natura, -quod omnes ·
corporis offecti sensus Ρ61· membra quiescunt

praeterea meminisse iacet languetque sopore 765
nec dissentit eum mortis letique potitum ¹
iam pridem, quem mens vivom se cernere credit.
quod superest, non est mirum simulacra moveri
bracchiaque in numerum iactare et cetera membra;
nam fit ut in somnis facere hoc videatur imag03 770
quippe ubi prima perit alioque est altera nata
inde statu, prior hic gestum mutasse videtur.
scilicet id fieri celeri ratione putandumst:
tanta est mobilitas et rerum copia tanta

sure: for sometimes in sleep an image is seen to do this: when the first
to wit has gone and a second then been born in another posture, that
former one seems to have altered its attitude. This remember you must
assume to take place with exceeding celerity: so great is the velocity,

Qize is the store of particles‚ out of which the supply may go on. ἡ
And here many questions present themselves and many points must
be cleared up by us, if we desire to give a plain exposition of things.
The first question is why, when the wish has occurred to any one to·
think of a thing, his mind on the instant thinks of that very thing. Do s
idols observe our will, and so soon as we will does an image present

itself to us, if sea, if earth, aye or heaven is what we wishl Assemblies
