ferreus occulte decrescit vomer in arviS‚
strataque iam volgi pedibus detrita viarum 3 ῐ 5
saxea conspicimus3 tum portas propter aena
signa manus dextras ostendunt adtenuari
saepe salutantum tactu praeterque meantum.
haec igitur minui, cum sint detrita, videmus,
sed quae corpora decedant in tempore quoque, 320
invida praeclusit spatium natura videndi.
postremo quaecumque dies naturaque rebus
paulatim tribuit, moderatim crescere cogenS,
nulla potest oculorum acies contenta tueri;
nec porro quaecumque aevo macieque senescunt, 325
nec, mare quae inpendent, vesco sale saxa peresa
quid quoque amittant in tempore cernere possis,
corporibus caecis igitur natura gerit res,
Nec tamen undique corporea stipata tenentur
omnia natura3 namque est in rebus inane. 330
quod tibi cognosse in multis erit utile rebus
, nec sinet errantem dubitare et quaerere semper
de summa rerum et nostris diffidere dictis.

iron imperceptibly decreases in the fields, and we behold the stone-paved
streets worn down by the feet of the multitude, the brass statues too at the
gates shew their right hands to be wasted by the touch of the numerous
passers by who greet them. These things then we see are lessened,
after they are thus worn down 3 but what bodies depart at any given
time nature has jealously shut out the means of seeing. Lastly the
bodies which time and nature add to things by little and little, con-
straining them to grow in due measure, no exertion of the eyesight can
behold3 and so too wherever things grow old by age and decay, and when
rocks hanging over the sea are eaten away by the fine salt spray, you

cannot see what they lose at any given moment. Nature therefore
works by unseen bodies.

And yet all things are not on all sides jammed together and kept in
by body: there is also void in things. To have learned this will be
good for you on many accounts 3 it will not suffer you to wander in
doubt and be to seek in the sum of things and distrustful of our words.
If there were not void, things could not move at all 3 for that which is
the property of body, to let and hinder, would be present to all things at
