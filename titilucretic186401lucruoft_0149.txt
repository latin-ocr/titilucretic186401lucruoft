01 lions, cunning with foxes and proneness to flight with stags? and to
take any other instance 01 1116 kind, why are all qualities engendered in
the limbs and temper from the very commencement 01 1116, 11001 because
a fixed power 01 mind derived from its proper seed and breed grows up
together with the whole body? If it were immortal and wont to pass
into different bodies, living creatures would be 01 interchangeable dis-

wild-beasts would have reason. For the assei-tion that an immortal 30111
13 altered by a change of body is advanced on a false principle. What
is changed, is dissoloed, and therefore dies: the parts are transposed and
quit their former order 3 therefore they must admit of being dissolved
throughout the frame, 10 order at last to die one and all together with
the body. But if they shall say that 301113 01 1060 always go into human

to the subterfuge that the mind grows weakly in a weakly body. But
