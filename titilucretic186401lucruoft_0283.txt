qui numero diffidebant armisque vacabant.
Nexilis ante fuit vestis quam textile tegmen. 1350

tektile post ferrumst, quia ferro tela paratur,

nec ratione alia possunt tam levia gigni

insilia ac fusi radii scapique sonantes,

et facere ante viros lanam natura coegit

quam muliebre genus3 nam longe praestat in arte 135 5

et sollertius est multo genus omne virile3

agricolae donec vitio vertere severi,

ut muliebribus id manibus concedere vellent

atque ipsi pariter durum sufferre laborem

atque opere in duro durarent membra manusque. 1 360

But men chose thus to act not so much in any hope of victory, 38 from
a wish to give the enemy something to rue at the cost of their own liveS‚
when they mistrusted their numbers and were in want of arms.

A garment tied on the body was in use before a dress of woven stuff.
Woven stuff comes after iron, because the loom is fitted with iron 3 and
in no other way can such finely polished things be made, as heddles and
spindles, shuttles and rin ging yarn-beams. And nature impelled men
to work up the wool before womankind: for the male sex in general far
excels the other in skill and is much more ingenious: until the rugged
countrymen so upbraided them with it, that they were glad to give it
over into the hands of the women and take their share in supporting
hard toil, and in such hard work hardened body and hands.

But nature parent of things was herself the first model of sowing and
first gave rise to grafting, since berries and acorns dropping from the
trees would put forth in due season swarms of young shoots underneath ;
and hence also came the fashion of inserting grafts in their stocks and
planting in the ground young saplings over the fields. Next they would
try another and yet another kind of tillage for their loved piece of land
