principio nequeunt ullius corporis esse
sensus ante ipsam genitam naturam animantia
nimirum quia materies disiecta tenetur
aere fluminibus terris terraque creatiS, 940
nec congressa modo vitalis convenienti
contulit inter se motus,‚ quibus omnituentes
accensi sensus animante in quaque cientur.
Praeterea quamvis animantem grandior ictus»,
quam patitur natura, repente adfligit et omnis 945
corporis atque animi pergit confundere sensus,
dissoluuntur enim positurae principiorum
et penitus motus vitales inpediuntur,
donec materieS, omnis concussa per artu5,
vitalis animae nodos a corpore solvit 950
dispersamque foras per caulas eiecit omnis,
nam quid praeterea facere ictum posse reamur
oblatum, nisi discutere ac dissolvere quaeque?
fit quoque uti soleant minus oblato acriter ictu
reliqiii motus vitalis vincere saepe, 955
vincere, et ingentis plagae sedare tumultus
inque suos quicquid rursus revocare meatus
et quasi iam leti dominantem in corpore motum
discutere ac paene amissos accendere sensus,

6611666 cannot exist in any body before the nature itself of the living
things has been begotten, because sure enough the matter remains
scattered about in air rivers earth and things produced from earth, and
has not met together and combined in appropriate fashion the vital
motions by which the all-discerning senses are kindled into action in
each living thing.

Again a blow more severe than its nature can endure, prostrates
at once any living thing and goes on to stun all the senses of body
and mind. For the positions of the first-beginnings are broken up and
the vital motions entirely stopped‚ until the matter, disordered by the
shock through the whole frame, unties from the body the vital fasten-
ings of the soul and scatters it abroad and forces it out through al] the
pores. For what more can we suppose the infliction of a blow can do,
than shake from their place and break up the union of the several
elements‘l Osten too when the blow is inflicted with less violence the
remaining vital motions are wont to prevail, to prevail I say and
still the huge disorders caused by the blow and recall each part into its
proper channels and shake off the motion of death now reigning as it

were pai-amount in the body and kindle afresh the almost lost 6611666.
