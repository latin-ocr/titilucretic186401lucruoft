dummodo quod capias concoctum didere possis

Nunc aliis alius qui sit cibu' suavis et almus
expediam, quareve, aliis quod triste et amarumst,
hoc tamen esse aliis possit perdulce videri, ’ 635
tantaque in his rebus distantia differitasque,
ut quod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum.

Ι will now explain how it is that different food is pleasant and

nutritious for different creatures, also why that which to some is
nauseous and bitter, may yet to others seem passing sweet 3 and why in
thaee matters the. difference and discrepancy is so great that what to ,one
man is food, to another is rank poison: thus there may exist a serpent
which on being touched by a man’s spittle wastes away and destroys
itself by gnawing its body. Again hellebore for us is rank poison, but
helps to fatten goats and quails. That you may know how this comes
to pass, first of all you must remember what we have said before, that
the seeds which are contained in things are mixed up in manifold ways,
Again all living creatures soever which take food, even- as they are un-
like on the outside, and differing after the kind of each an exterior con-
tour of limbs bounds them, so likewise are they formed of seeds of
varying shape. Again since the seeds differ, there must be a dis-
crepancy in the spaces between and the passages, which we name
openings‚ in all the limbs and mouth and palate as well. Some seeds
