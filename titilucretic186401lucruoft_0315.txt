dispertitur ut horror et incutit inde tremorem3
frigus uti nostros penitus cum venit in artuS,
concutit invitos cogens tremere atque movere. 595
ancipiti trepidant igitur terrore per urbiS,
tecta superne timent, metuunt inferne cavernas
terrai ne dissoluat natura repente,
neu distracta suum late dispandat hiatum
adque suis confusa, velit complere ruinis, 600
proinde licet quamvis caelum terramque reantur

throughout their cities ,· they fear the roofs above their heads, they

underneath3 and rent asunder display her own wide-gaping maw and
wildly tumbled together seek to fill it up with her own ruins. Let them
then fancy as much as they please that heaven and earth shall be incor-
ruptible and consigned to an everlasting exemption from decay 5 and yet
sometimes the very present force of danger applies on some side or other
this goad of fear among others, that the earth shall in an instant be
withdrawn from under their feet and carried down into the pit, and that
the sum of things shall utterly give way and follow after and a jumbled
wreck of world ensue.

First of all they wonder that nature does not increase the bulk of
the sea, when there is so great a flow of water into it, when all rivers
from all quarters fall into it. Add to these passing rains and flying
storms, which bespatter every sea and moisten every land 3 add its own
springs 3 yet all these compared with the sum of the sea will be like an
