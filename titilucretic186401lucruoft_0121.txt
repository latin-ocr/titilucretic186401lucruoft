et retro fit uti contra sit saepe vicissim,
cum miser ex animo laetatur corpore toto;
non· alio pacto quam si, pes cum dolet aegri, 110
in nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.
praeterea molli cum somno dedita membra
effusumque iacet sine sensu corpus honustum,
est aliud tamen in nobis quod tempore in illo
multimodis agitatur et omnis accipit in se 115
laetitiae motus et curas cordis inanis,
nunc animam quoque ut in membris cognoscere possis

μ’ 0330 neque harmonia corpus sentire solere,
principio fit uti detracto corpore multo
saepe tamen nobis in membris vita moretur ; 120
atque eadem rursum, cum corpora pauca caloris
diffugere forasque per os est editus aer,
deserit extemplo venas atque ossa relinquit3
noscere ut hinc possis non aequas omnia partis-e
corpora habere neque ex aequo fulcire salutem, 125
sed magis haec, venti quae sunt calidique vaporis
semina, curare in membris ut vita moretur.
est igitur calor 00 ventus vitalis in ipso
corpore qui nobis moribundos deserit artus,
quapropter quoniam est animi natura reperta 130
atque animae quasi pars 11011111113, redde harmoniai

oftentimes the caseis the very reverse, the man who is unhappy in mind
feeling pleasure in his whole body 3 just as if, while a sick man’s foot 13
pained‚ the head meanwhile should be 111 110 pain at all. Moreover when
the limbs are consigned to soft sleep and the burdened body lies diffused
without sense, there is yet a something else in 113 which during that time
13 moved in many ways and admits into it all the motions of joy and
unreal cares of the heart. Now that you may know that the 30111 03
well is in the limbs and that the body is not wont to have sense by any
harmony, this is a main proof : when much os the body has been taken
away, still life osten stays in the limbs 3 and yet the same life, when a
few bodies of heat have been dispersed abroad and some air has been
forced out through the mouth, abandons at once the veins and quits the
bones: by this you may perceive that all bodies have not functions of
like importance nor alike uphold existence, but rather that those seeds
which constitute wind and heat, cause life to stay in the limbs. There-
fore vital heat and wind are within the body, and abandon our frame
at death. Since then the nature of the mind and of the soul have been
proved to be a part as it were of the man, sui-render the name of har-
