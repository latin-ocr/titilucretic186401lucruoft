92 II

915 vitali ut possint consentire undique sensu.
qui poterunt igitur rerum primordia dici
et leti vitare vias, animalia cum sint,
adque animalia sint mortalibus una eademque?
quod tamen ut possint, at coetu concilioque 920
920 nil facient praeter volgum turbamque animantum,
scilicet ut nequeant homines armenta feraeque
inter sese ullam rem gignere conveniundO.
924 quod si forte suum dimittunt corpore sensum
atque alium capiunt, quid opus fuit adtribui id quod 925
detrahitur? tum praeterea, quo fugimus ante,
quatenus in pullos animalis vertier ova
cernimus alituum vermisque effervere, terram
intempestivos quom putor cepit ob imbris
scire licet gigni posse ex non sensibu' sensus. 930
Quod si sorte aliquis dicet dumtaxat oriri
posse a non sensu sensum mutabilitate,
aut alio tamquam partu quod proditus extet,
huic satis illud erit planum facere atque probare
non fieri partum nisi concilio ante coacto 935
nec quicquam commutari sine conciliatu

feel the things which we feel in the same way as we do, in order that
they may be able on all hands to work in concert with the vital sense.
How then can they be called first-beginnings of things and shun the
paths of death, seeing that they are living things, and that living things
are one and the same with mortal things? N ay granting they could do
this, yet by their meeting and union they will make nothing but a
jumble and medley of living things ; just you are to know as men cattle
and wild-beasts would be unable to beget any other thing by all their
mixing with one another. But if haply they lose from their body their
own sense and adopt another, what use to assign what is again with-
drawn‘l moreover, the instance to which we had before recourse, in-
asmuch as we see the eggs of fowls change into living chicks and
worms burst forth, when putridity has seized on the earth after ex-

cessive raim, you are to know that sensations can be begotten out of

-sensations
no But if haply any one shall say that sense so far may arise from no-

sensation by a process of change, or because it is brought forth by a
kind of birth, it will be enough to make plain and to prove to him that
no birth takes place until a union of elements has first been effected,
and that nothing changes without such a process of uniting. Above all
