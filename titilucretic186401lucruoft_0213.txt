blandaque ‘refrenat morsus admixta voluptas, 1085
namque in eo spes est, unde est ardoris origo,

restingui quoque posse ab eodem corpore flammam.
quod fieri contra totum natura repugnat3

unaque res haec est, cuius quom plurima habemus

tum magis ardescit dira cuppedine pectus 1090
nam cibus atque umor membris adsumitur intus;

quae quoniam certas possunt obsidere partiS,

hoc facile expletur laticum frugumque cupido,

ex hominis vero facie' pulchroque colore

nil datur in corpus praeter simulacra fruendum 1095
tenvia3 quae vento spes raptast saepe misella.

ut bibere in somnis sitiens quom quaerit et umor

non datur, ardorem qui membris stinguere possit,

sed laticum simulacra petit frustraque laborat

aetatiS, iam cum praesagit gaudia corpus

atque in eost Venus ut muliebria conserat arva,
adfigunt avide corpus iunguntque salivas

may likewise be quenched 3 the direct contrary of which nature protests
to be the case ς and this is the one thing of all, in which, when we have
-most of it, then all the more the breast burns with fell desire. Meat and
drink are taken into the body 3 and as they can fill up certain fixed
parts, in this way the craving for drink and bread is easily satisfied 3
but from the face and beauteous bloom of man nothing is given into the
body to enjoy save flimsy idols 3 a sorry hope which is often snatched off
by the wind. As when in sleep a thirsty man seeks to drink and water
is not given to quench the burning in his frame, but he seeks the idols
of waters and toils in vain and thirsts as 110 drinks in the midst of the
torrent stream, thus in love Venus mocks lovers with idols, nor can
bodies satisfy them by all their gazing upon them nor can they with
their hands rub aught off the soft limbs, wandering undecided over the
whole body. At last when they have united and enjoy the flower of
age, when the body now has a presage of joys and Venus is in the mood
to sow the fields of woman, tley greedily clasp each other's body and
