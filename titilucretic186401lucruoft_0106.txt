nam qua re potius leti iam limine ab ipso 960
ad vitam possit conlecta mente reverti,
quam quo decursum prope iam siet ire et abire?
Praeterea quoniam dolor est ubi materiai
corpora vi quadam per viscera viva per artus
sollicitata suis trepidant in sedibus intus, 96 5
inque locum quando remigrant‚ fit blanda voluptaS,
scire licet nullo primordia posse dolore
temptari nullamque voluptatem capere ex se;

ensues, you are to know that first-beginnings can be assailed by no
pain and can derive no pleasure from themselves ; since they are not
formed of any bodies of first-beginnings, so as to be distressed by any
novelty in their motions or derive from it any fruit of fostering delight ς
and therefore they must not be possessed of any sense.

Again if in order that living creatures may severally have sense,
sense is to be assigned to their first-beginnings as well, what are we to say
of those of which mankind is specifically made? sure enough they burst
into fits of shaking laughter and sprinkle with dewy tears face and
cheeks and have the cunning to speak at length on the nature of things
and enquire next what their own first-beginnings are 3 since like in their
natures to the entire mortals they must in their turn be formed out of
other elements, then those others out of others, so that you can venture
