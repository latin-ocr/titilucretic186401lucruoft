omnia perfunctus vitai praemia marces,

sed quia semper aves quod abest, praesentia temnis,
inperfecta tibi elapsast ingrataque vita

et nec opinanti mors ad caput adstitit ante

quam satur ac plenus possis discedere rerum. 960 ’
1111110 aliena tua tamen aetate omnia mitte

aequo animoque agedum gnatis concede: necessest?

iure, ut opinor, agat, iure increpet inciletque3

cedit enim rerum novitate extrusa vetustas

semper, et ex aliis aliud reparare necessest; 965
nec quisquam in barathrum nec Tartara deditur atra:
materies opus est ut crescant postera saecla;

quae tamen omnia te vita perfuncta sequentur;

she would bring her charge, with reason rally and reproach 3 for old things
give way and are supplanted by new without fail, and one thing must ever
be replenished out of other things 3 and no one is delivered over to the pit
and black Tartarus : matter is needed for after generations to grow 3 all
of which though will follow thee when they have finished their term of
life3 and it follows that all these no less than thou have before this

never ceases to rise out of another, and life is granted to none in fee-
simple, to all 111 usufruct. Think too how the bygone antiquity of ever-
lasting time before our birth was nothing to us. Nature therefore holds
this up to 118 as a mirror of the time yet to come after our death. Is
