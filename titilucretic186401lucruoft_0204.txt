cum volumUS, varieque datum sit membra movere,

et quae res tantum hoc oneris protrudere nostri
corporis insuerit, dicam: tu percipe dicta. 880
dico animo nostro primum simulacra meandi

accidere atque animum pulsare, ut diximus ante.

inde voluntas fit3 neque enim facere incipit ullam

rem quisquam, quam mens providit quid velit ante.

id quod providet, illius rei constat imago, 885
ergo animus cum sese ita commovet ut velit ire

inque gredi, ferit extemplo quae in corpore toto

per membra atque artus animai dissita vis est.

et facilest factm quoniam coniuncta tenetur.

inde ea proporro corpus ferit, atque ita tota 890
paulatim moles protruditur atque movetur.

praeterea tum rarescit quoque corpusxet aer,

scilicet ut debet qui semper mobilis extat,

per patefacta venit penetratque foramina largus

et dispargitur ad partis ita quasque minutas 895
corporis, hic igitur rebus fit utrimque duabuS,

aeque id ut ac navis velis ventoque feratur.

nec tamen illud in his rebus mirabile constat,

tantula quod tantum corpus corpuscula possunt

please, and how it is given us to move about our limbs, and what cause
is wont to push sorward the great load of this our body I will tell: do
you take in my words. I say that idols of walking first present them-
selves to our mind and strike on the mind, as we said before: then the
will arises3 for no one begins to do anything‚ until his mind has pre-
determined what it wills. From the very fact that it predetermines
such thing, there is an image of that thing. When therefore the mind
bestirs itself in such a way as to will to walk and step out, it strikes at
the same moment the force of the soul which is spread over the whole
body throughout the limbs and frame 3 and this is easily done, since the
whole is held in close union with the mind. Next the soul in its turn
'strikes the body, and thus the whole mass by degrees is pushed on and
set in motion. Then again the body becomes also rarcfied‚ and the air,
as you 800 its nature is, being always so nimble in moving, comes and
passes in great quantity through the opened peres and is thus dis-
tributed into the most minute parts of the body. In this way then by
these two causes acting in two different ways the body just like a ship
is carried on by sails and wind. And herein it need not excite any
surprise that such very minute bodies can steer 80 great a body and turn
