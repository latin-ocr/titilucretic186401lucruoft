corpora constabunt ex partibus infinitis

quippe ubi dimidiae partis pars semper habebit

dimidiam partem nec res praefiniet ulla.

ergo rerum inter summam minimamque quid escit?

nil erit ut distet3 nam quamvis funditus omnis 620

summa sit infinita, tamen, parvissima quae sunt,

ex infinitis constabunt partibus aeque.

quod quoniam ratio reclamat vera negatque

credere posse animum, victus fateare necessest

esse ea quae nullis iam praedita partibus extent 625

et minima constent natura. quae quoniam sunt,

illa quoque esse tibi solida atque aeterna fatendum.

denique si minimas in partis cuncta resolvi

cogere consuesset rerum natura creatriX,

iam nil ex illis eadem reparare valeret 630

propterea quia, quae nullis sunt partibus aucta,

non possunt· ea quae debet genitalis habere

materieS‚ varios conexus pondera plagas

concursus motus, per quae res quaeque geruntur.
Quapropter qui materiem rerum esse putarunt 635

ignem atque ex igni summam consistere so10,

magno opere a vera lapsi ratione videntur.

Heraclitus init quorum dux proelia primuS,

the very smallest bodies will consist of infinite parts, inasmuch as the
half of the half will always have a half and nothing will set bounds to
the division. Therefore between the sum of things and the least of
things what difference will there be? There will be no distinction at
all 3 for how absolutely infinite soever the whole sum is, yet the things
which are smallest will equally consist of infinite parts. Now since on,
this head true reason protests and denies that the mind can believe it,
you must yield and admit that there exist such things as are possessed
of no parts and are of a least nature. And since these exist, those first
bodies also you must admit to be solid and everlasting. Once more, if
nature creatress of things had been wont to compel all things to be
broken up into least parts, then too she would be unable to reproducor
anything out of those parts, because those things which are enriched
with no parts cannot have the properties which begetting matter ought
to have, I mean the various entanglements weights blows clashings
motions by means of which things severally go on.

For which reasons they who have held fire to be the matter of things
and the sum to be formed out of fire alone, are seen to have strayed
most widely from true reason. At the head of whom enters Heraclitus
