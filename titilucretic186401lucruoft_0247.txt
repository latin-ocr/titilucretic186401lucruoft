And 111 order that the earth may rest in the middle of the world, it
is proper that its weight should gradually pass away and be lessened,
and that it should have another nature underneath it conjoined from the

’ beginning of its existence and formed into one being with the airy

portions of the world in which it is embodied and lives. For this reason
it is no burden and does not weigh down the air 3 just as his limbs are of
· 110 weight to a man nor is his head a burden to his neck, nor do we feel
that 1110 whole weight of the body rests on the feet3 but whatever
weights come from without and are laid upon us, hurt us though they
310 often very much smaller: of such very great moment it 13 what
function each thing has to perform. Thus then the earth is not an
alien body suddenly brought in and forced from some other quarter 011
air alien to it, but was conceived tos ether with it, at the first birth
