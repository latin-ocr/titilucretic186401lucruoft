multa minuta, iaci quae possint ordine eodem

quo fuerint et formai servare figuram,

et multo citiuS, quanto minus indupediri 70

pauca queunt et sunt in prima fronte locata.

nam certe iacere ac largiri multa videmUS,

non solum ex alto penitusque, ut diximus ante,

verum de summis ipsum quoque saepe colorem.

et volgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela 75

et ferrugina, cum magnis intenta theatris

per malos volgata trabesque trementia flutant3

namque ibi consessum caveai supter et omnem

quae volgo volitant suptili praedita filo

nec singillatim possunt secreta videri.

praeterea omnis odor fumus vapor atque aliae res 90

be discharged in the same order they had before and preserve the outline
of the shape‚ and be discharged with far more velocity, inasmuch as they
are less liable to get hampered being few in number and stationed in the
front rank. For without doubt we see many things discharge and freely
give not only from the core and centre, but from their sur-facea be-
sides other things colour itself. And this is commonly done by yellow
and red and dark-blue awnings, when they are spread over large theatres
and flutter and wave as they stretch across their poles ς for then they dye
the seated assemblage below and all the show of the stage and the richly
attired company of the fathers, and compel them to dance about in their
colour. And the more these objects are shut in all round by the walls
of the theatre, the more do all of them within laugh on all hands, o’er-
laid with graceful hues, the light of day being narrowed. Therefore
since sheets of canvas emit colour from their surface‚ all things will natu-
rally emit thin pictures too, since in each case alike they discharge from the
surface. There are therefore as now shewn sure outlines of shapeS‚ which
fly all about possessed of an exquisitely small thickness and cannot when
separate be seen one at a time. Again all smell smoke heat and other
