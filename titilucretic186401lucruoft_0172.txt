160 IV

perpetuo fluere ut noscas e corpore *summo
texturas rerum tenuis tenuisque figuras
ergo multa brevi spatio simulacra genuntur‚
ut merito celer -his rebus dicatur origo, 160
et quasi multa brevi spatio summittere debet
lumina sol ut perpetuo sint omnia plena,
sic ab rebus item simili ratione necessest
temporis in puncto rerum simulacra ferantur
multa modis multis in cunctas undique partis; 165
quandoquidem speculum quocumque obvertimus oriS‚
res ibi respondent simili forma atque colore.
Praeterea modo cum fuerit liquidissima caeli
tempestaS, perquam subito fit turbida foede,
undique uti tenebras omnis Acherunta rearis 170
liquisse et magnas caeli complesse cavernas,
usque adeo taetra nimborum nocte coorta
inpendent atrae formidinis ora superne;
‘ quorum quantula pars sit imago dicere nemost
qui possit neque eam rationem reddere dictis, 175
’ Nunc age, quam celeri motu simulacra ferantur
et quae mobilitas ollis tranantibus auras
reddita sit, longo spatio ut brevis hora teratur,
in quem quaeque locum diverso numine tendunt,

Therefore many idols are begotten in a short time, so that the birth of
such things is with good reason named a rapid one. And as the sun
must send forth many rays of light in a short time in order that all
things may be continually filled with it, so also for a like reason there
must be carried away from things in a moment of time idols of things
many in number in many ways in all directions round 3 since to whatever
part of them we present a mirror before their surfaceS, other things cor-
respond to these in the mirror of a like shape and like colour.

Moreover though the state of heaven has just before been of unsullied
purity, with exceeding suddenness it becomes so hideously overcast, that
you might imagine all its darkness had abandoned Acheron throughout
and filled up the great vaults of heaven: in such numbers, mid the
frightful night of stom-clouds that has gathered, do faces of black
horrour hang over us on high. Now there is no one who can tell how
small a fraction of these an image is, or express that sum in language.

Now mark: how swift the motion is with which idols are borne
along, and what velocity is assigned to them as they scour through the
air, so that but a short hour is spent on a journey through long space,
