128 III

dilaniata foras dispargitur, interit ergo,
quin etiam si iam libeat concedere falsum “ 540
et dare posse animam glomerari in corpore eorum,
lumina qui lincunt moribundi particulatim,
mortalem tamen esse animam fateare necesse,
nec refert utrum pereat dispersa per auras
an contracta suis e partibus obbrutescat‚ 545
quando hominem totum magis ac magis undique sensus
deficit et vitae minus et minus undique restat.

Et quoniam mens est hominis pars una, loco quae
fixa manet certO, velut aures atque oculi sunt
atque alii sensus qui vitam cumque gubernant, 550
et veluti manus atque oculus naresve seorsum
secreta ab nobis nequeunt sentire neque esse,
sed tamen in parvo licuntur tempore tabe,
sic animus per se non quit sine corpore et ipso
esse homine, illius quasi quod vas 6886 videtur 555
sive aliud quid vis potius coniunctius ei
fingere, quandoquidem conexu corpus adhaeret.

Denique corporis atque animi vivata potestas
inter se coniuncta valent vitaque fruuntur3
nec sine corpore enim vitalis edere motus 560
sola potest animi per se natura nec autem

dies, Moreover if I were pleased for the moment to grant what is false
and admit that the soul might be collected in one mass in the body of
those who leave the light dying piecemeal, even then you must admit
the soul to be mort-0113 and it makes no difference whether it perish
dispersed in air, or gathered into one lump out of all its parts lose all
feeling, since sense ever more and more fails the whole man throughout
and less and less of life remains throughout.

And since the mind is one part of a man which remains fixed in a
particular spot, just as are the ears and eyes and the other senses which
guide and direct life 3 and just as the hand or eye or nose when separated
from us cannot feel and exist apart, but in however short a time waste
away in putrefaction‚ thus the mind cannot exist by itself without the
body and the man’s self which as you see serves for the mind's vessel or
any thing else you choose to imagine which implies a yet closer union
with it, since the body is attached to it by the nearest ties.

Again the quickened power of body and mind by their joint partner-
ship enjoy health and life 3 for the nature of the mind cannot by itself

alone without the body give forth vital motions nor can the body again
