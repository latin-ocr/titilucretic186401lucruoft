at contra quaecumque magis cum pondere magno
asperaque inveniuntur, eo stabilita magis sunt.

nunc igitur quoniam est animi natura reperta

mobilis egregie, perquam constare necessest

corporibus parvis et levibus atque rutundis, 205
quae tibi cognita res in multiS, o bone, rebus

utilis invenietur et opportuna cluebit.

haec quoque res etiam naturam dedicat eius,

quam tenui constet textura quamque 1060 86

quod simul atque hominem leti secura quies est

indepta atque animi natura animaeque recessit,

nil ibi libatum de toto corpore cernas

ad speciem, nil ad pondus: mors omnia praestat
vitalem praeter sensum calidumque vaporem. 215

have, the more stable they are. Since then the nature of the mind has
been found to be eminently easy to move, it must consist of bodies ex-
ceedingly small smooth and round, The knowledge of which fact, my
good friend, will on many accounts prove useful and be servioeable to
you. The following fact 1300 likewise demonstrates how fine the texture
is of which its nature is composed, and how small the room is in which
it ean be contained, could 113 only be collected into one mass: soon as the
untroubled sleep of death has gotten hold of a man and the nature of
the mind and 80111 has withdrawn, you can perceive then no diminution
of the entire body either in appearance or weight: death makes all good
save the vital sense and heat. Therefore the whole 80111 must consist
of very small seeds and be inwoven through veins flesh sinews 5 inasmuch
as, after it has withdrawn from the whole body, the exterior contour
of the limbs preserves itself entire and not a tittle of the weight is lost.
