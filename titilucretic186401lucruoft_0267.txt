V 255

sed magis illud erat curae, quod saecla ferarum
infestam miseris faciebant saepe quietem.
eiectique domo fugiebant saxea tecta
spumigeri suis adventu validive leonis 985
atque intempesta cedebant nocte paventes
hospitibus saevis instrata cubilia fronde.

Nec nimio tum plus quam nunc mortalia saecla
dulcia linquebant labentis lumina vitae.
unus enim tum quisque magis deprensus eorum 990
pabula viva feris praebebat, dentibus haustUSâ€š
et nemora ac montis gemitu silvasque replebat
viva videns vivo sepeliri viscera busto,
at quos effugium servarat corpore adeso,
posterius tremulas super ulcera taetra tenentes 995
palmas horriferis accibant vocibus Orcum,
donique eos vita privarant vermina saeva
expertis opiS, ignaros quid volnera vellent.
at non multa virum sub signis milia ducta
una dies dabat exitio nec turbida ponti 1000
aequora fligebant navis ad saxa virosque.

saevibat leviterque minas ponebat inanis,
nec poterat quemquam placidi pellacia ponti

repose fatal to the poor wretches. And driven from their home they
would fly from their rocky shelters on the approach of a foaming boar

to their savage guests their sleeping-places strawn with leaves.

Nor then much more than now would the races of mortal men leave
the sweet light of ebbing life. For then this one or that other one of
them would be seized, and torn open by their teeth would furnish to the
wild-beasts a living food, and would fill with his moam'ng woods and
mountains and forests as he looked on his living flesh buried in a living
grave. But those whom flight had saved with body eaten into, holding
ever aster their quivering palms over the noisome sores would summon
death with appalling eries, until cruel gripings had rid them of life,
forlorn of help, unwitting what wounds wanted. But then a single day
gave not over to death many thousands of men marching with banners
spread, nor the stormy waters of the sea dashed on the rocks men and
ships. At this time the sea would often rise up and rage without aim,
without purpose, without result, and just as lightly put off its empty
threats 3 nor could the winning wiles of the calm sea treacherously
