multi de magnis per somnum rebu' loquuntur

indicioque sui facti persaepe fuere.

multi mortem obeunt. multi, de montibus altis 1020

ut qui praecipitent ad terram corpore toto,

externantur et ex somno quasi mentibu' capti

vix ad se redeunt permoti corporis aestu.

flumen item sitiens aut fontem propter amoenum

adsidet et totum prope faucibus ‘occupat amnem. 1025

puri saepe lacum propter si ac dolia curta

people often, when sound asleep‚ believing that they are lifting their
dress beside a urinal or the public vessels, pour forth the filtered liquid

liancy are drenched. Then too those, into the boiling currents of whose
age seed is for the first time passing, when the ripe fulness of days has
produced it in their limbs, idols encounter from without from what body
soever, harbingers of a glorious face and 3 beauteous bloom, which stir
and excite the appropriate portions of the frame and often occasion
fruitless anticipations of the pleasures of love.

That seed we have spoken of before is stirred up in us, as soon
as mature age fortifies the frame. For as different causes set in motion
