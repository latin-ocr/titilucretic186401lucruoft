nec sanctum numen fati protollere finis
posse neque adversus naturae foedera 1111312 310
denique 11011 monimenta virum dilapsa videmUS,
aeraque proporro solidumque senescere ferr-um,
non ruere avolsos silices a montibus altis
nec validas aevi vires perferre patique
finiti? neque enim caderent avolsa repente, 315
ex infinito quae tempore pertolerassent
omnia tormenta aetatis privata fragore.

Denique iam tuere hoc, circum supraque quod omnem
continet amplexu terram: si procreat ex se
omnia, quod quidam memorant, recipitque perempta, 320
totum nativum mortali corpore constat.
nam quodcumque alias ex se res auget alitque,
deminui debet, recreari, cum recipit res.

Praeterea si nulla fuit genitalis origo
terrarum et caeli semperque aeterna fuere, 325
cur supera bellum Thebanum et funera Troiae

quo tot facta virum totiens cecidere neque usquam
aeternis famae monimentis insita florent?

naturast mundi neque pridem exordia cepit.

see we not the monuments of men fall to ruin, and fur-thermore brass
and solid iron grow oldv basalt-rocks tumble down riven away from high
mountains and unable to endure and suffer the strong might of finite
age? surely they would never fall suddenly riven away, if for infinite
time past they had held out against all the batteries of age without

a crash.

Again gaze on this, which about and above holds in its embrace all
the earth: if it begets all things out of itself, as some say, and takes
them back when they are destroyed, then the whole of it has had a birth
and is of a mortal body 3 for whatever gives increase and food out of
itself to other thingsâ€ž must be lessened 3 and must be replenished, when
it takes things back.

Again if there was no birth-time of earth and heaven and they have
been from everlasting, why before the Theban war and the destruction
of Troy have not other poets as well sung other themes? whither have
so many deeds of men so often passed away and nowhere live embodied
in lasting records of fame? The truth methinks is that the sum has but
a recent date and the nature of the world is new and has but lately had
