commutari aliqua possint ratione revicta,

incertum quoque iam constet quid possit oriri,

quid nequeat, finita potestas denique cuique 595
quanam sit ratione atque alte terminus haerenS,

nec totiens possint generatim saecla referre

naturam mores victum motusque parentum.

Tum porro quoniam est extremum quodque cacumen
corporis illius quod nostri cernere sensus 600
iam nequeunt, id nimirum sine partibus extat
et minima constat natura nec fuit umquam
per se secretum neque posthac esse valebit,
alterius quoniamst ipsum pars, primaque et una
inde aliae atque aliae similes ex ordine partes 605
agmine condenso naturam corporis explent,
quae quoniam per se nequeunt constare, necessest
haerere unde queant nulla ratione revelli.
sunt igitur solida primordia simplicitate
quae minimis stipata cohaerent partibus arte, 610
non ex illarum conventu conciliata,
sed magis aeterna pollentia simplicitate,
unde neque avelli quicquam neque deminui iam
concedit natura reservans semina rebus
praeterea nisi erit minimum, parvissima quaeque 615

quished and changed, it would be then uncertain too what could and
what could not rise into being, in short on what principle each thing
has its powers defined, its deepset boundary mark 3 nor could the gene-
rations reproduce so often each after its kind the nature habits way of
life and motions of the parents.

Then again since there is ever a bounding point to that first body
which already is beyond what our senses can perceive, that point sure
enough is without parts and consists of a least nature and never has
existed apart by itself and will not be able in future so to exist, since
it is in itself part of that other, and so a first and single part and then
other and other similar parts in succession fill up in close serried mass
the nature of the first body 3 and since these cannot exist by them-
selveS, they must cleave to that from which they cannot in any way be
torn. First-beginnings therefore are of solid singleness, massed together
and cohering closely by mea-ns of least parts, not compounded out of a
union of those parts, but, rather, strong in everlasting singleness. From
them nature allows nothing to be torn, nothing further to be worn away,
reserving them as seeds for things. Again unless there shall be a least,
