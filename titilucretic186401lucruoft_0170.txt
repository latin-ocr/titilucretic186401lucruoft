primum animalia sunt iam partim tantula, quorum
tertia pars nulla possit ratione videri.

horum intestinum quodvis quale esse putandumst!

quid cordis globus aut 0011112 quid membra? quid artus?

nonne vides quam sint subtilia quamque minuta?

in the case of all things which exhale from their body a pungent smell,
all-heal, nauseous wormwood, strong-scentes] southernwood and the
bitter centauries‚ any one of which, if you happen to [feel it] lightly be-

rather you are to know that idols of things wander about many in
number in many ways, of no force, powerless to excite sense.

But lest haply you suppose that only those idols of things which go
off from things and no others wander about, there are likewise those
which are spontaneously begotten and are formed by themselves in this
ο lower heaven which is called air: these fashioned in many ways are
borne along on high and being in a fluid state cease not to alter their
appearance and change it into the outline of shapes of every possible
