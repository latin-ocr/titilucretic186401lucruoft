quod nequeunt oculis rerum primordia cerni,

accipe praeterea quae corpora tute necessest

confiteare esse in rebus nec posse videri. 270
principio venti vis verberat incita portus

ingentisque ruit navis et nubila differt,

interdum rapido percurrens turbine campos

arboribus magnis sternit montisque supremos

silvifragis vexat flabris: ita perfurit acri 275
curn fremitu saevitque minaci murmure ventus,

sunt igitur venti nimirum corpora caeca

quae mare, quae terraS‚ quae denique nubila caeli
verrunt ac subito vexantia turbine raptant,

nec ratione fluunt alia stragemque propagant 280
et cum mollis aquae fertur natura repente

flumine abundanti, quam largis imbribus auget
montibus ex altis magnus decursus aquai

fragmina coniciens silvarum arbustaque tota,

nec validi possunt pontes venientis aquai 28 5
vim subitam tolerare: ita magno turbidus imbri
molibus incurrit validis cum viribus amnis,

dat sonitu magno stragem volvitque sub undis

grandia saxa ruitque aqua quidquid fluctibus obstat.

sic igitur debent venti quoque flamina ferri, 290

the first-beginnings of things cannot be seen by the eyes, take more-
over this list of bodies which you must yourself admit are in the number
of things and cannot be seen. First of all the force of the wind when
aroused beats on the harbours and whelms huge ships and scatters
clouds 3 sometimes in swift whirling eddy it scours the plains and
straws them with large trees and scourges the mountain summits with
forest-rending blasts: so fiercely does the wind rave with a shrill howling
and rage with threatening roar. Winds therefore sure enough are un-
seen bodies which sweep the seas, the lands, ay and the clouds of heaven,
tormenting them and catching them up in sudden whirls. On they
stream and spread destruction abroad in just the same way as the soft
liquid nature of water when all at once it is borne along in an over-
flowing stream, and a great downfall of water from the high hills aug-
ments it with copious rains, fiinging together fragments of forests and
entire trees 3 nor can the strong bridges sustain the sudden force of
coming water: in such wise turbid with much rain the river dashes
upon the piers with mighty strength. With a loud noise the water

μ makes havoc, and rolls under its eddies huge stones and throws down

whatever opposes its waves. In this way then must the blasts of wind
