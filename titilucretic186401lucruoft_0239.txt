dissociare intus partis ut materiai

corpora sunt quorum naturam ostendimus ante, 355
aut ideo durare aetatem posse per omnem,

plagarum quia sunt expertia, sicut inane est

quod manet intactum neque ab ictu fungitur hilum,

aut etiam quia nulla loci fit copia circum,

quo quasi res possint discedere dissoluique, 360
sicut summarum summa est aeterna neque extra

qui locus est quo dissiliant, neque corpora sunt quae
possint incidere et valida dissolvere plaga.

at neque, uti docui, solido cum corpore mundi

naturast, quoniam admixtumst in rebus inane, 365
nec tamen est ut inane, neque autem corpora desunt,
ex infinito quae possint forte coorta

corruere hanc rerum violento turbine summam

aut aliam quamvis cladem inportare pericli,

nec porro natura loci spatiumque profundi 370
deficit, exspargi quo possint moenia mundi,

aut alia quavis possunt vi pulsa perire.

haut igitur leti praeclusa est ianua caelo

nec soli terraeque neque altis aequoris nudie,

sed patet immani et vasto respectat hiatu. 375
quare etiam nativa necessumst confiteare

sufficient to disunite the closely massed parts within: such are the
bodies of matter whose nature we have shewn before: or they must be
able to endure through all time for this reason, because they are exempt
from blows, as void is which remains untouched and suffers not a jot
from any stroke 3 or else because there is no extent of room around, into
which things so to say may dep-art aud be broken up: in this way the
sum of sums is eternal and there is no place outside into which things
may spring asunder, nor are there any bodies which can fall upon them
and dissolve them by a powerful bloW. But the nature of the world, as
I have shewn, is neither of solid body, since void is mixed up in all
things, nor is it again like void, no nor is there lack of bodies that
may haply rise up in mass out of the infinite and overthrow this sum of
things with furious tornado 01Î‡ bring upon them some other perilous
disaster-3 nor further is the nature of room and the space of deep void
wanting, into which the walls of the world may be scattered abroad 3 or
they may be assailed and perish by some other force. Therefore the
gate of death is not closed against heaven or sun or earth or deep wate-rs
of the sea, but stands open and looks towards them with a huge wide-
gaping maw. And therefore also you 'must admit that these things
