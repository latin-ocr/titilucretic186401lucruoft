stridit, ubi in gelidum propere demersimus imbrem.
aridior porro si nubes accipit ignem, 150
uritur ingenti sonitu succensa repente3

lauricomos ut si per montis flamma vagetur

turbine ventorum comburens impete magno3

nec res ulla magis quam Phoebi Delphica laurus

terribili sonitu flamma crepitante crematur. 155
denique saepe geli multus fragor atque ruina

plunged it quickly into cold water. Again if the cloud which receives
the fire is drier‚ it is set on fire in an instant and burns with a loud
noise 3 just as if a fiame should range over the laurel-covered hills
through a whirlwind and burn them up with its impetuous assault 3 and
there is not anything that burns in the crackling flame with a more
startling sound than the Delphic laurel of Phoebus. Then often too
much crushing of ice and tumbling in of hail make a noise in the great
clouds on high 3 for when the wind packs them together into a confined
space, the mountains of storm-clouds congealed and mixed with hail
break up.

It lightens too, when the clouds have struck out by their collision
many seeds of fire 3 just as if a stone were to strike another stone or a
piece of iron 3 for then too light bursts out and fire scatters about many
sparks. But we hear the thunder with our ears after the eyes see the
fiash of lightning, because things always travel more slowly to the ears
than those which excite vision travel to the eyes. This you may per-
ceive from the following instance too: when you see a man at a distance
cutting with a double-edged axe a large trec, you perceive the stroke
before the blow carries the sound to the ear: thus we see lightning too
