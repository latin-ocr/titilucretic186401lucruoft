in statione locata sepultis undique ventis:
tum poteris magnas moles cognoscere eorum
speluncasque velut saxis pendentibu' structas 19 5 ⁸
cernere, quas venti cum tempestate coorta
conplerunt, magno indignantur murmure clausi
nubibus in caveisque ferarum more minantur;
nunc hinc nunc illinc fremitus per nubila mittunt
quaerentesque viam circum versantur et ignis 200
semina convolvunt e nubibus atque ita cogunt
multa rotantque cavis flammam fornacibus intus,
donec divolsa fulserunt nube corusci.

Hac etiam fit uti de causa mobilis ille
devolet in terram liquidi color aureus ignis, 205
semina quod nubes ipsas permulta necessust
ignis habere; etenim cum sunt umore sine 11110,
flammeus est plerumque colos et splendidus ollis,
quin etiam solis de lumine multa necessest
concipere, ut merito rubeant ignesque profundant. 210
hasce igitur cum ventus agens contrusit in unum
compressitque locum 0080113, expressa profundunt
semina quae faciunt fiammae fulgere colores

fulgit item, cum rarescunt quoque nubila caeli.
nam cum ventus eas leviter diducit euntis 215

rest the winds being buried on all sides: you will then be able to ob-
serve their great masses and 110 300 caverns as it were built of hanging
rocks 3 and when a storm has gathered and the winds have filled these,
they chafe with a loud roaring shut up in the clouds, and bluster 111
their dens after the fashion of wild beasts: now from this point, now
from that they send their growlings through the clouds, and seeking a
way out whirl about and roll together seeds of fire out of the clouds and
then gather many into a mass and make them rotate in the hollow fur-
naces within, until they have burst the cloud and shone forth in forked
flasheS.

From this cause again yon golden colour of clear bright fire flies down
with velocity to the earth: the clouds must themselves have very many
seeds of fire 3 for when they are without any moisture, they are mostly
of a brilliant fiame-colour. Moreover they must take in many from the
sun's light, so that with good cause they are ruddy and shed forth fires.
When therefore the wind has driven thrust squeezed together and col-
lected into one spot these clouds, they press out and shed forth seeds
which cause the colours of fiame to flash out. It also lightens‚ when the
clouds of heaven are rarefied as well. For when the wind lightly un-
