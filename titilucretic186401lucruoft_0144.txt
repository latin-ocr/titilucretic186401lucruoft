pictores itaque et scriptorum saecla priora
sic animas intro duxerunt sensibus auctas. 630
at neque sorsum oculi neque nares nec manus ipsa
esse potest animae neque sorsum lingua, neque aures
auditu per se possunt sentire neque esse.

Et quoniam toto sentimus corpore inesse
vitalem sensum et totum esse animale videmUS, 63 5
si subito medium celeri praeciderit ictu
vis aliqua ut sorsum partem secernat utramque,
dispertita procul dubio quoque vis animai
et discissa simul cum corpore dissicietur.
at quod scinditur et partis discedit in ullaS, 640
scilicet aeternam sibi naturam abnuit esse.
falciferos memorant currus abscidere membra
saepe ita de subito permixta caede calentiS‚
ut tremere in terra videatur ab artubus id quod
decidit abscisum, cum mens tamen atque hominis vis 645
mobilitate mali non quit sentire dolorem3
et semel in pugnae studio quod dedita mens est,

inter equos abstraxe rotas falcesque rapaceS, 650
nec cecidisse alius dextram, eum scandit et instat.

‘And since we pereeive that vital sense is in the whole body and we
see that it is all endowed with life, if on a sudden any force with swift
blow shall have cut it in twain so as quite to dissever the two halves‚ the
power of the soul will without doubt at the same time be cleft and
cut asunder and dashed in twain together with the body. But that
which is cut and divides into any partS, you are to know renounces for
itself an everlasting nature. Stories are told how scythed chariots
reeking with indiscriminate slaughter often lop off limbs so instantane-
ously that that which has fallen down lopped off from the frame is seen
to quiver on the ground, while yet the mind and faculty of the man
from the suddenness of the mischief cannot feel the pain3 and because

⁴ his mind once for all is wholly given to the business of fighting, with

what remains of his body he mingles in the fray and carnage‚ and often
perceives not that the wheels and devouring scythes have carried off
among the horses' feet his left arm shield and all3 another sees not that
