perspiciemus et unde queat res quaeque creari

155 et quo quaeque modo fiant opera sine divom.

159 Nam si de nilo fierent, ex omnibu' rebus
omne genus nasci posset, nil semine egeret. 160
e mare primum homineS, e terra posset oriri
squamigerum genus et volucres erumpere caelo;
armenta atque aliae pecudes, genus omne ferarum,
incerto partu culta ac deserta tenerent.
nec fructus idem arboribus constare solerent, 165
sed mutarentur, ferre omnes omnia possent.
quippe, ubi non essent genitalia corpora cuique,
qui posset mater rebus consistere certa?
at nunc seminibus quia certis quaeque creantur,
inde enascitur atque oras in luminis exit, 170
materies ubi inest cuiusque et corpora prima;
atque hac re nequeunt ex omnibus omnia gigni,
quod certis in rebus inest secreta facultas
praeterea cur vere rosam, frumenta calore,

si non, certa suo quia tempore semina rerum
cum confluxerunt, patefit quodcumque creatur,
dum tempestates adsunt et vivida tellus

are pursuing, both the elements out of which every thing can be pro-
duced and the manner in which all things are done without the hand of
the gods.

If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of any thing,
nothing would require seed. Men for instance might rise out of the
sea, the scaly race out of the earth, and birds might burst out of the
sky 3 horned and other herds, every kind of wild-beasts would haunt
with changing brood tilth and wilderness alike. Nor would the same
frujts keep constant to trees, but would change, any tree might bear
any fruit. For if there were not begetting bodies for each, how
could things have a fixed unvarying mother? But in fact because
things are all produced from fixed seeds, each* thing is born and goes
forth into the borders of light out of that in which resides its matter
and first bodies 3 and for this reason all things cannot be gotten out
of all things, because in particular things ‚resides a distinct power.
Again why do we see the rose put forth in spring, corn in the season of
heat, vines yielding at the call of autumn, if not because, when the fixed
seeds of things have streamed together at the proper time, whatever is
born discloses itself, while the due seasons are there and the quickened
earth brings its weakly products in safety forth into the borders of
