there is void mixed up in things. But on the other hand if the first
beginnings of things be soft‚ it cannot be explained out of what enduring
basalt and iron can be produced 3 for their whole nature will utterly
lack a first foundation to begin with. First-beginnings therefore are
strong in solid singleness‚ and by a denset· combination of these all

things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength.
Again if no limit has been set to the breaking of bodies, nevertheless

the several bodies which go to things must survive from eternity up to

the present time, not yet assailed by any danger. But since they are
possessed of a frail nature, it is not consistent with this that they could
have continued through eternity harassed through ages by countless
blows. Again too since a limit of growing and sustaining life has been
assigned to things each after its kind, and since by the laws of nature it
stands decreed what they can each do and what they cannot do, and
since nothing is changed, but all things are so constant that the different
birds all in succession exhibit in their body the distinctive marks of
their kind, they must sure enough have a body of unchangeable matter
also. For if the first-beginnings of things could in any way be 17311-Δ
