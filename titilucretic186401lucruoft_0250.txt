nonne vides etiam quam late parvus aquai
prata riget fons interdum campisque redundet?
est etiam quoque uti non magno solis ab igni
aeia percipiat calidis fervoribus ardor, 603
opportunus ita est si forte et idoneus aer,
ut queat accendi parvis ardoribus ictus3
quod genus interdum segetes stipulamque videmus
accedere ex una scintilla incendia passim.
forsitan et rosea sol alte lampade lucens 610
possideat multum caecis fervoribus ignem
circum se, nullo qui sit fulgore notatuS,
aestifer ut tantum radiorum exaugeat ictum.
Nec ratio solis simplex et certa patescit,
quo pacto aestivis e partibus aegocerotis 615
brumalis adeat flexus atque inde revertens

lunaque mensibus id spatium Videatur obire,
annua sol in quo consumit tempora cursu.
non, inquam, simplex his rebus reddita causast. 620
nam fieri vel cum primis id posse videtur,

in such manner, that this beat wells forth from a single source. See
you not too what a breadth of meadow-land a small spring of water
sometimes floods, streaming out over the fields2 It is likewise possible
that heat from the sun's fiame though not at all great may infect the
whole air with fervent fires, if haply the air is in a suitable and suscepti-
ble state, so that it can be kindled when struck by small bodies of heat ;
thus we see sometimes a general conflagration from a single spark catch
fields of corn and stubble. Perhaps too the sun as he shines aloft
with rosy lamp has round about him much fire with heats that are not
visible and thus the fire may be marked by no radiance, so that fraught
with heat it increases to such a degree the stroke of the rayS.

Nor with regard to the sun is there one single explanation, certain
and manifest, of the way in which he passes from his summer positions
to the midwinter turning-point of capricorn and then turning back from
thence bends his course to the solstitial goal of cancer, and how the
moon is seen once a month to pass over that space, in traversing which
the sun spends the period of a year. No single plain cause, I say, has
been assigned for these things. It seems highly probable that that may
be the truth which the revered judgment of the worthy man Democritus
maintains: the nearer the different constellations are to the earth, the
