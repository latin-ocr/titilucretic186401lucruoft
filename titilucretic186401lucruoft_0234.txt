haec eadem ferme mortalia cernimus esse
et nativa simul. quapropter maxima mundi
cum videam membra ac partis consumpta regigni‚
scire licet caeli quoque item terraeque fuisse 245
principiale aliquod tempus clademque futuram.

Illud in his rebus ne corripuisse rearis
me mihi, quod terram atque ignem mortalia sumpsi
esse neque umorem dubitavi aurasque perire
atque eadem gigni rursusque augescere dixi, 250
principio pars terrai nonnulla, perusta
solibus adsiduiS, multa pulsata pedum vi, '
pulveris exhalat nebulam nubesque volantis
quas validi toto dispergunt aere venti.
pars etiam glebarum ad diluviem revocatur 255
imbribus et ripas radentia flumina rodunt.
praeterea pro parte sua, quodcumque alid auget,
redditur; et quoniam dubio procul esse videtur
omniparens ‘eadem rerum commune sepulcrum,
ergo terra tibi libatur et aucta recrescit. 260

therefore I 366 that the chiefest members and parts of the world are
destroyed and begotten anew, Ι may be sure that for heaven and earth
as well there has been a time of beginning and there will be a time of
destruction.

And herein that you may not think that I have unfairly seized on
this point for myself, because I have assumed that earth and fire are
morta] and have not doubted that water and air perish, and have said
that these are likewise begotten and grow afresh‚ mark the proofs: first
of all some portion of the air, burnt up by constant suns, trampled by a
multitude of feet, sends forth a cloud and flying eddies of dust, which
the strong winds disperse over the whole air. Part too of the soil 13
again put under water by 131113, and rivers graze against and eat into
the banks. Again whatever increases something else, is in its turn
replenished3 and since beyond a doubt earth the universal mother is
found at the same time to be the general tomb of things, therefore you
see she is lessened and increases and grows again.

, Furthermore‚ that sea rivers fountains always stream over with new
moisture and that waters well up without ceasing, it needs no words to
prove: the great flow of waters from 4311 sides clearly shews it. But
