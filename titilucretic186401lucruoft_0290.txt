278 VI

hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque necessest
non radii solis nec lucida tela diei 40
discutiant, sed naturae species ratioque.
quo magis inceptum pergam pertexere dictis
Et quoniam docui mundi mortalia templa
esse et nativo consistere corpore caelum,
et quaecumque in eo fiunt fierique necessest, 45
pleraque ressolui, quae restant percipe porm,

quandoquidem semel insignem conscendere currum
ἦε

ventorum, ex ira ut placentur, ut omina rursum

quae fuerint sint placato conversa surore:

cetera quae fieri in terris caeloque tuentur 50
mortales, pavidis cum pendent mentibu' saepe,

et faciunt animos humilis formidine divom

depressosque premunt ad terram propterea quod
ignorantia causarum conferre deorum

cogit ad imperium res et concedere regnum, 55
nam bene qui didicere deos securum agere aevom,

si tamen interea mirantur qua ratione

therefore and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the
sun and glittering shafts of day, but by the aspect and law of nature.
Wherefore the more readily I will go on in my verses to complete the
web of my design.

And since I have shewn that the quarters of ether are mortal and
that heaven is formed of a body that had a birth, and since of all the
things which go on and must go on in it, I have unravelled most, hear
further what remains to be told; since once for all [Ι have willed] to
mount the illustrious chariot [of the muses, and ascending to heaven to
explain the true law of winds and storms, which men foolishly lay to
the charge of the gods, telling how when they are angry, they raise
fierce tempests 3 and, when there is a lull in the fury] of the winds, how
that anger is appeased, how the omens which have been, are again
changed when their fury has thus been appeased: [I have willed at the
same time] to explain all the other things which mortals observe to go
on upon earth and in heaven, when often they are in anxious suspense
of mindsand which abase their souls with sear of the gods and weigh
and press them down to earth, because ignorance of the causes constrains
them to submit things to the empire of the gods and to make over to
them the kingdom. For they who have been rightly taught that the
gods lead a life without care, if nevertheless they wonder on what plan
