I 11

nullius exitium patitur natura videri.

praeterea quaecumque vetustate amovet aetas 225
si penitus peremit consumens materiem omnem,

unde animale genus generatim in lumina vitae

redducit Venus aut redductum daedala tellus

unde alit atque auget generatim pabula praebens?

unde mare, ingenuei fontes externaque large 230
flumina suppeditant? unde aether sidera pascit?

omnia enim debet, mortali corpore quae sunt,

infinita aetas consumpse anteacta diesque.

quod si in eo spatio atque anteacta aetate fuere

e quibus haec rerum consistit summa refecta, 235
inmortali sunt natura praedita certe,

haut igitur possunt ad nilum quaeque reverti.

denique res omnis eadem vis causaque volgo

conficeret, nisi materies aeterna teneret,

inter se nexu minus aut magis indupedita3 240
tactus enim leti satis esset causa profectO,

quippe, ubi nulla forent aeterno corpore, quorum
contextum vis deberet dissolvere quaeque.

at nunc, inter se quia nexus principiorum

dissimiles constant aeternaque materies est, 245

to dash things to pieces by a blow or to pierce through the void plac-es
within them and break them up. Again if time, whenever it makes
away with things through age, utterly destroys them eating up all their
matter, out of what does Venus bring back into the light of life the
race of living things each after its kind, or, when they are brought back,
out of what does earth manifold in works give them nourishment and
increase, furnishing them with food each after its kind2 The sea, its
native fountains and extraneous rivers, out of what are they supplied2
Out of what does ether feed the stars'l For infinite time gone by and
lapse of days must have eaten up all things which are of mortal body.
Now if in that period of time gone by those things have existed, of
which this sum of things is composed and recruited, they are possessed
no doubt of an imperishable body, and cannot therefore any of them
return to nothing. Again the same force and cause would destroy all
things without distinction, unless everlasting matter held them together,
matter more or less closely linked in mutual entanglement: a touch in
sooth would be sufficient cause of death, inasmuch as any amount of
force must of course undo the texture of things in which no parts at all

were of an everlasting body. But in fact, because the fastenings of
first-beginnings one with the other are unlike and matter is everlasting,
