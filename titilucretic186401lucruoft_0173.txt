tendency, all this Ι will tell in sweetly worded rather than in many
verses 3 as the short song of the swan is better than the loud noise of
cranes scattered abroad amid the ethereal clouds of the south. First of

between, ever driven on by a blow following behind 3 for light on the
instant is replaced by light and brightness goaded to shew its brightness
in what you might call an ever on-moving team. Therefore in like
manner idols must be able to scour in a moment of time through space
unspeakable‚ first because they are exceeding *small and there is a cause
at their back to carry and impel them forward 3 next because when
emitted they are possessed of so rare a texture, that they can readssy
