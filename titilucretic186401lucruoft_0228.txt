succidere horrisono posse omnia victa fragore.
Â³ [Qua prius adgrediar quam de re fundere fata 1 10

Pythia quae tripode a Phoebi lauroque profatur,
multa tibi expediam doctis solacia dictis3
religione refrenatus ne forte rearis

that they after the fashion of the giants should all suffer punishment for
their monstrous guilt, who by their reasoning displace the walls of the
world and seek to quench the glorious sun of heaven, branding immortal
things in mortal speech 3 though in truth these things 316 80 far from
possessing divinity and are so unworthy of being reckoned in the number
of gods, that they may be thought to afford a notable instance of what
is quite without vital motion and sense. For it is quite impossible to
suppose that the nature and judgment of the mind can exist with any
body whatever 3 even as a tree cannot exist in the ether nor clouds in
the salt sea nor can fishes live in the fields nor blood exist 111 woods nor
