- Morever, you see, nightly lights which belong to earth, such as hanging

η μ’ ¹ i lamps and torches bright with darting flames, hasten in like fashion amid

great darkness with ministering heat to supply new light 3 are eager to
bicker with fires, eager I say 3 nor is the light ever broken off nor does
it quit the spots illuminated: with such suddenness from all the fires
is its destruction concealed by the swift birth of flame. In the same ⁴
way then we must believe that sun moon and stars emit light from fresh
and ever fresh supplies rising up, and always lose every previous dis-

Again see you not that even stones are conquered by time, that
high towers fall and rocks moulder away, that shrines and idols of gods
are worn out with decay‚ and. that the holy divinjty cannot prolong the
