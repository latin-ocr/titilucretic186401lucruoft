tractari, non invenio qui non sit acerbum

ignibus inpositum calidis torrescere flammis 890
'aut in melle situm suffocari atque rigere

frigore, cum summo gelidi cubat aequore saxi,

urgerive superne obtritum pondere terrae.

‘Iam iarn non doinus accipiet te laeta, neque uxor
optima nec dulces occurrent oscula nati 895
praeripere et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent.
non poteris factis florentibus esse, tuisque
praesidium. misero misere' aiunt ‘omnia ademit
