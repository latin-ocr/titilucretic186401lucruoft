body. Thus the heat and the air and the unseen power of the spirit
mixed together produce a single nature, together with that nimble force
which transmits to them from itself the origin of motion ς by which
means sense-giving motion first takes its rise though the fleshly frame.
For this nature lurks secreted in its inmost depths, and nothing in our
body is farther beneath all ken than it, and more than this it is the very
80111 of the whole soul. Just in the same way as the power of the mind
and the function of the 80111 are latent in our limbs and throughout our
body, because they are each formed of small and few bodies ε even so,
you are 130 know, this nameless power made of minute bodies is concealed
and is moreover the very 80111 80 130 say of the whole soul, and reigns
supreme in the whole body. On 0 like principle the spirit and air and
heat must, as they exert their powers be mixed up together through the
frame, and one must ever be more out of view or more prominent than
another, that one substance may be seen 130 be formed from the union of
all, lest the heat and spirit apart by themselves and the power of the air
apart by itself should destroy sense and dissipate it by their disunion.
Thus the mind possesses that heat which it displays when it boils up in
anger and fire flashes from the keen eyes, there 18 too much cold spirit ᾖ
