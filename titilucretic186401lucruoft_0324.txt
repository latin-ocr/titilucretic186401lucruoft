nocturnumque recens extinctum lumen ubi acri

nidore offendit nareS, consopit ibidem,-

concidere et spumas qui morbo mittere suevit.
castoreoque gravi mulier sopita recumbit

et manibus nitidum teneris opus effluit ei, 795
tempore eo si odoratast quo menstrua solvit.

multaque praeterea languentia membra per artus
solvunt atque animam labefactant sedibus intus,

denique si calidis etiam cunctare lavabris

plenior et laveris, solio ferventis aquai 800
quam facile in medio fit uti des saepe ruinas!

carbonumque gravis vis atque odor insinuatur

quam facile in cerebrum, nisi aquam praecepimus ante!

at cum membra domus percepit fervidior viS‚

tum fit odor viri plagae mactabilis instar. 805
nonne vides etiam terra quoque sulpur in ipsa

gignier et taetro concrescere odore bitumen3

denique ubi argenti venas aurique secuntur,

terrai penitus scrutantes abdita ferm,

qualis expiret Scaptensula subter odores? 810
quidve mali fit ut exhalent aurata metalla!

in her seat, and her gay work drops out of her soft hands, if she has
smelt it at the time when she has her monthly discharges. And many
things besides relax through all the srame the sainting limbs and shake
the soul 111 its seats within. Τ11011 too if you linger long in the hot baths
when you are somewhat full and bathe, how liable you are to tumble
down in a fit while seated 111 the midst of the hot water! Again how
readily do the oppressive power and. fumes of charcoal make their way
into the brain, if we have not first taken water! But when burning
with more than usual force it has filled the chambers of a house, then the
fumes of the virulent substance act like a murderous blow. See you
not too that even within the earth sulphur is generated and asphalt
forms incrustations of a noisome stenoh'.z see you not, when they are
following up the veins of silver and gold and searching with the pick
quite into the bowels of the earth, what stenehes Scaptensula exhales
from below? Then what mischief do gold mines exhale! to what state
