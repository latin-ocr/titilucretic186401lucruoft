148 III

hoc est adverso nixantem trudere monte 1000
saxum quod tamen e summo iam vertice rusum
volvitur et plani raptim petit aequora campi.
deinde animi ingratam naturam pascere semper
atque explere bonis rebus satiareque numquam,
quod faciunt nobis annorum tempora, circum 1005
011111 redeunt fetusque ferunt variosque leporeS,
nec tamen explemur vitai fructibus umquam,
hoc, ut opinor, id est, aevo florente puellas
quod memorant laticem pertusum congerere in vae,
quod tamen expleri nulla ratione potestur. 1010
Cerberus et furiae iam vero et lucis egestas

³2:-
Tartarus horriferos eructans faucibus 0031113,
qui neque sunt usquam nec possunt esse profecto,
sed metus in vita poenarum pro male factis
est insignibus insigniS, scelerisque luella, 1005
carcer et horribilis de saxo iactu' deorsum,
verbera carnifices robur pix lammina taedae;
quae tamen etsi absunt, at mens sibi conscia factis
praemetuens adhibet stimulos terretque flagellis
nec videt interea qui terminus esse malorum 1020
possit nec quae sit poenarum denique finis

forcing 011-11111 with much effort a stone which after all 10113 back again
from the summit and seeks in headlong haste the levels of the plain.
Then to be ever feeding the thankless nature of the mind, and never to
fill it full and sate it with good things, as the seasons of the year do for
us, when they come round and bring their fruits and varied delights,
though after all we are never filled with 1110 enjoyments of life, this me-
thinks 13 10 do what is told of 1110 maidens in the flower of their age, to
keep pouring water into a perforated vessel which in spite of all can
never be filled full. Moreover Cerberus and the furies and yon privation
of light [are idle tales, 03 well 03 011 1110 1031, Ixion’s wheel and black]
Tartarus belching forth hideous fires from his throat: things which
nowhere are nor sooth to say can be. But there 13 10 life 0 dread of
punishment for evil deeds, signal as the deeds are signal, and as atone-
ment of guilt, the prison and the frightful hurling down from the rock‚
scourgings executionem, the dungeon of the doomed, the pitch, the metal
plate, torches 3 and even though these are wanting, yet the conscience-
stricken mind through boding fears applies to itself goads and frightens
itself with whip8‚ and sees not meanwhile what end there can be of ills
