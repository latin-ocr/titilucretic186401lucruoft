ignoratur enim quae sit natura animai,

nata sit an contra nascentibus insinuetur,

et simul intereat nobiscum morte dirempta

an tenebras Orci visat vastasque lacunas 115
an pecudes alias divinitus insinuet se,

Ennius ut noster cecinit qui primus amoeno

detulit ex Helicone perenni fronde coronam,

per gentis Italas hominum quae clara clueret3

etsi praeterea tamen esse Acherusia templa 120

Helicon a crown of unfading leaf, destined to bright renown throughout
Italian clans of men. Though yet with all this Ennius sets forth that
there are Acherusian quarters, publishing it in immortal verses 3 though
in our passage thither neither our souls nor bodies hold together, but
only certain idols pale in wondrous wise. From these places he relatos
that the ghost of everliving Homer uprose before him and began to shed
salt tears and to unfold in words the nature of things. Wherefore we
must well grasp the principle of things above, the principle by which the
courses of the sun and moon go on, the force by which every thing
on earth proceeds, but above all we must find out by keen-sighted reason
what the soul and the nature of the mind consist of, and what thing it
is which meets us and frightens our minds when we are awake and under
the influence of disease and when we are buried in sleep, so that we
