DE RERUM NATURA

LIBER QUINTUS

Quis potis est dignum pollenti pectore carmen

condere pro rerum maiestate hisque repertis?

quisve valet Verbis tantum qui fingere laudes

pro meritis eius possit qui talia nobis

pectore parta suo quaesitaque praemia liquit? 5
nem0‚ ut opinor, erit mortali corpore cretus

nam si, ut ipsa petit maiestas cognita rerum,

dicendum est, deus ille fuit, (16113, inclyte Memmi,

qui princeps vitae rationem invenit eam quae

nunc appellatur sapientia, quique per artem 10
fluctibus e tantis vitam tantisque tenebris

in tam tranquillo et tam clara luce locavit.

confer enim divina aliorum antiqua reperta.

namque Ceres fertur fruges Liberque liquoris

vitigeni laticem mortalibus instituisse3 15
cum tamen his posset sine rebus vita manere,

ut sama est aliquas etiam nunc vivere gentis

Who is able with powerful genius to frame a poem worthy of the
grandeur of the things and these discoveries‘l 01· who is so great a
master of words as to be able to devise praises equal 10 1113 merits who
left to us such prizes won and earned by his own 861111132 N one
methinks who is formed of mor-tal body. For if we must speak as the
acknowledged grandeur of the things itself demands, a god he was, a
god, most noble Memmius, who first found 0111 that plan of life which is
now ter-med wisdom‚ and who by trained skill rescued life from such
great billows and such thick darkness and moored it in so perfect a calm
and iu so brilliant a light. Compare the godlike discoveries of others in
old times: Ceres is famed to have pointed out 10 mortals corn, and Liber
the vine-born juice of the grape 3 though life might well have subsisted
without these 11111183, as we are told some nations even now live without
