non alia longe ratione ac plumbea saepe
fervida fit glans in curm, cum multa rigoris
corpora dimittens ignem concepit in auris, ³*
fit quoque ut ipsius plagae vis excitet ignem,
frigida cum venti pepulit vis missa sine igni, 310
nimirum quia, cum vementi perculit ictu,
confluere ex ipso possunt elementa vaporis
et simul ex illa quae tum res excipit ictum;
ut, lapidem ferro cum caedimUS, evolat igniS‚
nec, quod frigida vis ferrist‚ hoc setius illi 315
semina concurrunt calidi fulgoris ad ictum.
sic igitur quoque res accendi fulmine debet,
opportuna fuit si forte et idonea flammis,
nec temere omnino plane vis frigida venti
esse potest, ea quae tanta vi missa supernest, 320
quin, prius in cursu si non accenditur igni,
at tepefacta tamen veniat commixta calore.
Mobilitas autem fit fulminis et gravis ictuS,
et celeri ferme percurrunt fulmina laPSU,
nubibus ipsa quod omnino prius incita se vis 325
colligit et magnum conamen sumit eundi,

along with it other bodies of very small size which mix with it and pro-

taken up fire in the air. Sometimes too the force of thei-*blow itself
strikes out fire, when the force of wind discharged in a cold state with·
out fire has struck, because sure enough, when it has smitten with a
powerful stroke, the elements of heat are able to stream together out of
the wind itself and at the same time out of the thing which then en-
counters the stroke. Thus, when we strike a stone with iron, fire ffies
out 3 and none the less, because the force of the iron is cold, do its seeds
of fiery brightness meet together upon the stroke. Therefore in the same
way a thing ought to be set on fire by the thunderbolt, if it has hap-
pened to be in a state suited to receive and susceptible of the flames. At
the same time the might of the wind cannot lightly be thought to be
absolutely and decidedly cold, seeing that it is discharged with such
force from above 3 but if it is not already set on fire during its course, it
yet arrives in a warm state with heat mixed up in it.

But the velocity of thunderbolts is great and their stroke powerfuL
and they run through their course with a rapid descent, because their
force when aroused first in all cases collects itself in the clouds and
