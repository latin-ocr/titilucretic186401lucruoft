qualibus in tenebris vitae quantisque periclis 15
degitur hoc aevi quodcumquest! nonne videre

nil aliud sibi naturam latrare, nisi ut, quoi

corpore seiunctus dolor absit, mente fruatur

iucundo sensu cura semotu' metuque? ’

ergo corpoream ad naturam pauca videmus 20
esse opus omnin0‚ quae demant cumque dolorem,
delicias quoque uti multas substernere possint.

gratius interdum neque natura ipsa requirit,'

si non aurea sunt iuvenum simulacra per aedes
lampadas igniferas manibus retinentia dextriS, 25
lumina nocturnis epulis ut suppeditentur,

1160 (10111118 argento fulget auroque renidet

nec citharae reboant laqueata aurataque tecta,

cum tamen inter se prostrati in gramine molli

propter aquae rivum sub ramis arboris altae 30
non magnis opibus iucunde corpora curant,

praesertim cum tempestas adridet et anni

tempora conspergunt viridantis floribus herbas,

nec calidae citius decedunt corpore febreS‚

textilibus si in picturis ostroque rubenti 35
iacteris‚ quam si in plebeia veste cubandum est.
quapropter quoniam nil nostro in corpore gazae

breasts! in what darkness of life and in how great dangers is passed
all this term of life whatever its duration! not choose to see that nature ’
’ craves for itself nothing more than that the man from whose body pain
holds aloof, should in mind enjoy a feeling of pleasure exempt from care
and sear? Therefore in respect of the body's nature we see that but
little is at all needed in order that such things as take away pain, should
be able to spread before us many delights as well. Nor at times does
nature herself want any greater solace‚ although there are no golden
images of youths through the house holding in their right hands flaming
lamps, for supply of light to the nightly banquet, though the house
shines not with silver nor glitters with gold nor do the pannelled and
gilded roofs reecho to the harp, what time, though these things be want-
ing, they spread themselves in groups on the soft grass beside a stream
of water under the boughs of a high tree and at no great cost pleasantly
refresh their bodies, above all when the weather smiles and the 86380118
of the year besprinkle the green grass with flowers. Nor do hot severs
sooner quit the body, if you toss about on pictured tapestry and blush·
ing purple, than if you must lie under a poor man’s blanket. Where-
fore since treasures avail nothing in respect of our body nor birth nor.
