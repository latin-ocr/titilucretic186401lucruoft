numquid ibi horribile apparet, num triste videtur
quicquam, non omni somno securius exstat?

Atque ea nimirum quaecumque Acherunte profundo
prodita sunt esse, in vita 'sunt omnia nobis,

nec miser inpendens magnum timet aere saxum 980 ⁴, ,ι

TantaIUS, ut famast, cassa formidine torpens 3

sed magis in vita divom metus urget inanis

mortalis casumque timent quem cuique ferat fors

nec Tityon volucres ineunt Acherunte iacentem

nec quod sub magno scrutentur pectore quicquam 985
perpetuam aetatem possunt reperire profectO.

quamlibet immani proiectu corporis exstet,

qui non sola novem dispessis iugera membris

optineat, sed qui terrai totius orbem,

non tamen aeternum poterit perferre dolorem 990
nec praebere cibum proprio de corpore semper.

sed Tityos nobis hic est, in amore iacentem

quem volucres lacerant atque exest anxius angor

aut alia quavis scindunt cuppedine curae.

And those things sure enough, which are fabled to be in the deep of
Acheron, do all exist for us in this life. No TantaluS, numbed by

“ groundless terror, as the story is, fears poor wretch a huge stone hanging

in air 3 but in life rather a baseless dread of the gods vexes mortals ε the
fall they sear is such fall ofluck as chance brings to each. Nor do birds eat
a way into Tityos laid in Acheron, nor can they sooth to say find during
eternity food to peck under his large breast. However huge the bulk
of body he extends, though such as to take up with outspread limbs not
nine acres merely, but the whole earth, yet will he not be able to endure
everlasting pain and supply food from his own body for ever. But he is
for us a Tityos, whom as he grovels in love vultures rend and bitter
bitter anguish eats up or troubled thoughts from any other passion do
rive. In life too we have a Sisyphus before our eyes who is bent on
asking from the people the rods and cruel axes, and always retires
defeated and disappointed. For to ask for power, which empty as it is
is never given, and always to undergo in the pursuit severe toil, this is
