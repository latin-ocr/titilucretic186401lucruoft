fiet uti cibus 01111118, et aridus et liquor ipse,

ossibus 813 nervis sanieque et sanguine mixto,

si sunt in terris, terram constare necessest

in lignis si flamma latet fumusque cinisque,

Linquitur hic quaedam latitandi copia tenviS, 875
id quod Anaxagoras sibi sumit, ut omnibus omnis
res putet inmixtas rebus latitare, sed illud
apparere unum cuius sint plurima mixta
et magis in promptu primaque in fronte locata.
quod tamen a vera longe ratione repulsumst. 880
conveniebat 8111111 fruges quoque saepe, minaci
robore cum saxi franguntur, mittere signum
sanguinis aut aliquid, nostro quae corpore aluntur;

food, solid as well as liquid, must be held to be composed of things
foreign to them in kind, of bones that is and sinews and matter and
blood mixed up. Again if all the bodies which grow out of the earth,
are in the 83113118, 13118 earth must be composed of things foreign to it
in kind which grow out of these earths. Apply again this reasoning
to other things, and you must 1188 just the same words. If flame and
smoke and asli are latent in woods, woods must necessarily be composed
of things foreign to them in kind. Again 311 those bodies, to which the
earth gives food, it increases [out of things foreign to them in kind which
rise 01113 of the earth: thus too the bodies of flame which issue from the
woods, are fed] out of things foreign to them in kind which rise out of
these woods.

Here some slight opening 18 left for evasion, which Anaxagoras
avails himself of, choosing to suppose that all things though latent are
mixed up in things, and that is alone visible of which there are the
largest number of bodies in the mixture and these more ready to hand
and stationed in the first rank. This however is far banished fr0m true
reason. For then it were natural that corn too should often, when
crushed by the formidable force of the stone, shew some mark of blood
or some other of the things which have their nourishment in our body;
