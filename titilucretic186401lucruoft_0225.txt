 

V 213

nunc etiam scatit et trepido terrore repleta est 40
per nemora ac montes magnos silvasque profundas;
quae loca vitandi plerumque est nostra potestas,
at nisi purgatumst pectus quae proelia nobis
atque pericula tumst ingratis insinuandum!
quantae tum scindunt hominem cuppedinis acres 45
sollicitum curae quantique perinde timores!
quidve superbia spurcitia ac petulantia? quantas
efficiunt clades! quid luxus desidiaeque?
haec igitur qui cuncta subegerit ex animoque
expulerit dictis, non armis, nonne decebit 50
hunc hominem numero divom dignarier esse?
cum bene praesertim multa ac divinitus ipsis
immortalibu’ de divis dare dicta suerit
atque omnem rerum naturam pandere dictis,

Cuius ego ingressus vestigia dum rationes 55
persequor ac doceo dictis, quo quaeque creata
foedere sint, in eo quam· sit durare necessum

‘nec validas valeant aevi rescindere leges

quo genere in primis animi natura reperta est

nativo primum consistere corpore creta 60
nec posse incolumis magnum durare per aevom,

now so abounds to repletion in wild beasts and is filled with troublous
terrour throughout woods and great mountains and deep forests 3 places
which we have it for the most part in our own power to shun. But
unless the breast is cleared, what battles and dangers must then find
their way into us in our own despite ! what poignant cares inspired by
lust then rend the distressful man, and then also what mighty fears!
and pride, filthy lust and wantonness‘l what disasters they occasion 3 and
luxury and all sorts of sloth‘l He therefore who shall have subdued all
these and banished them from the mind by words, not arms, shall he not
have a just title to be ranked among the gods ‘l and all the more so that
he was wont to deliver many precepts in beautiful and godlike phrase
about the immortal gods themselves and to open up by his writings all
the nature of things.

While walking in his footsteps I follow out his reasonings and teach
by my verses, by what law all things are made, what necessity there is
then for them to continue in that law, and how impotent they are to
annul the binding statutes of time: foremost in which class of things
the nature of the mind has been proved to be formed of a body that had
birth and to be unable to endure unscathed through great time, mere idols
