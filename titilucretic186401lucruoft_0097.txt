e quibus omne genus gignunt variantque colores
propterea, magni quod refert semina quaeque 760
cum quibus et quali positura contineantur

et quos inter se dent motus accipiantque,

perfacile extemplo rationem reddere possis

cur ea quae nigro fuerint paulo ante colore,

marmoreo fieri possint candore repente; 765
ut mare, cum magni commorunt aequora venti,

vertitur in canos candenti marmore fluctus;

dicere enim possiS‚ nigrum quod saepe videmUS,

materies ubi permixta est illius et ordo

principiis mutatus et addita demptaque quaedam, 770
continuo id fieri ut candens videatur et album.

quod si caeruleis constarent aequora ponti

nam quocumque modo perturbes caerula quae sint,
numquam in marmoreum possunt migrare colorem. 775
sin alio atque alio sunt semina tincta colore

dissimiles formaS, ita cernere in aequore ponti

of every kind and change them about by reason that it makes a great
difference with what other seeds and in what position the seeds are
severally held in union and what motions they mutually impart and
receive, you can explain at once with the greatest ease why those things
which just before were of a black colour, may become all at once of
marble whiteness3 as the sea, when mighty winds have stirred up its
waters, is changed into white waves of the brightness of marble: you
may say that when the matter of that which we often see to be black,
has been mixed up anew and the arrangement of its first-beginnings has
been changed and some have been added and some been taken away, the
immediate result is that it appears bright and white. But if the waters
of the sea consisted of azure seeds, they could in no wise become white 3
for however much you jumble together seeds which are azure, they can
never pass into a marble colour. But if the seeds which make up the
one unmixed brightness of the sea are dyed some with one, some with
⁴ 'other colourS, just as often out of different forms and varied shapes
something square and of a uniform figure is made up, in that case it
were natural that as we see unlike forms contained in the square, so we
should see in the water of the sea or in any other one and unmixed
