quamlubet et fortes et pulchro corpore creti.

quod siquis vera vitam ratione gubernet,

divitiae grandes homini sunt vivere parce

aequo animo; neque enim est umquam vpenuria parvi.
at claros homines voluerunt se atque potenteS, 1 120
ut fundamento stabili fortuna maneret

et placidam possent opulenti degere vitam,

nequiquam, quoniam ad summum succedere honorem

certantes iter infestum fecere viai,
et tamen e summo, quasi fulmen, deicit ictos 1125

invidia interdum contemptim in Tartara taetra;
1131 invidia quoniam, ceu fulmine, summa vaporant

plerumque et quae sunt aliis magis edita cumque3
1 127 ut satius multo iam sit parere quietum

quam regere imperio res velle et regna tenere. 1130

to mount up to the highest dignities they rendered their path one full of
danger 3 and even if they reach it, yet envy like a thunderbolt sometimes
strikes and dashes men down from the highest point with ignominy into
noisome Tartarus3 since the highest summits and those elevated above

wear themselves out to no purpose and sweat drops of blood, as they
struggle on along the strait road of ambition, since they gather their
knowledge from the mouths of others and follow after things from hear-
