nam cum mittitur, extemplo protrudit agitque
aera qui inter se cumque est oculosque locatuS,
isque ita per nostras acies perlabitur omnis
et quasi perterget pupillas atque ita transit.
251 propterea fit uti videamus quam procul absit 250
250 103 quaeque. et quanto plus aeris ante agitatur
et nostros oculos perterget longior aura,
tam procul esse magis res quaeque remota videtur.
scilicet haec summe celeri ratione geruntur,
quale sit ut videamus et una quam procul absit. 25 5
illud in his rebus minime mirabile habendumst,
cur, ea quae feriant oculos simulacra videri
singula cum nequeant, res ipsae perspiciantur.
ventus enim quoque paulatim cum verberat et cum
261 acre fluit frigus non privam quamque solemus 260
260 particulam venti sentire et frigoris eiuS,
sed magis unorsum, fierique perinde videmus
corpore tum plagas in nostro tamquam aliquae res
verberet atque sui det sensum corporis extra.
praeterea lapidem digito cum tundimuS, ipsum 265
tangimus extremum saxi summumque colorem,
1100 sentimus eum tactu, verum magis ipsam

duritiem penitus saxi sentimus in alto.

distant from us 3 for as soon as ever it is discharged, it pushes before it
and impels all the air which lies between it and the eyes ; and thus it
all streams through our eyes and brushes so to say the pupils and so
passes through. The consequence is that we see how far distant each
thing 13. And the greater thc quantity of air which is driven on before
it and the larger the current which brushes our eyes, the more distant
each different thing is seen to be. You must know these processes go
on with extreme rapidity, so that at one and the same moment we 300
what like a thing 13 and how far distant it is. And this must by no
means be deemed strange herein that, while the idols which strike the
eyes cannot be seen one at a time, the things themselves are seen. For
thus when the wind too beats us with successive strokes and when
piercing cold streams, we are not wont to feel each single particle of
that wind and cold, but rather the whole result ς and then we perceive
blows take effect on our body just as if something or other were beating

ἶ ſs it and giving us a sensation of its body outside. Again when we thump

a stone with a finger, we touch merely the outermost colour on the
surface of the stone, and yet we do not feel that colour by our touch, but
rather we feel the very hardness of the stone seated in its inmost depths,
