non quo multa parum communis littera currat
aut nulla inter se duo sint ex omnibus isdem,
sed quia non volgo paria omnibus omnia constant.
sic aliis in rebus item communia multa 695
multarum rerum cum sint primordia, verum
dissimili tamen inter se consistere summa

or verses one with another 010 made up entirely of the same, but
because as a rule they do not all resemble one the other. Thus also

And yet we are not to suppose that all things can be joined together
in all ways; for then you would see prodigies produced on all hands,
forms springing up half man half beast and sometimes tall boughs
sprouting from the living body, and many limbs of land-creatures joined
with those of sea-animals, nature too throughout the all-bearing lands
feeding chimeras which breathed flames from hideous mouth. It is
plain however that nothing of the sort is done, since we see that all
things produced from fixed seeds and a fixed mother can in growing
preserve the marks of their kind. This you 010 10 know must take
place after a fixed law. For the particles suitable for each thing from
all kinds of food when inside the body pass into the frame and joining
on produce the appropriate motions 3 but on the other hand we 300
