310 VI

is 100113 est Cumas aput, acri sulpure montes

oppleti calidis ubi fumant fontibus aucti.

est et Athenaeis in 1110011110113, 31013 111 ipso

vertice, Palladis ad templum Tritonidis almae, 7 50
quo numquam pennis appellunt corpora raucae

cornices, non cum fumant altaria donis:

usque adeo fugitant non iras Palladis acris

pervigili causa, Graium ut cecinere poetae,

sed natura loci ope sufficit ipsa suapte. 755
in Syria quoque fertur item 100113 0330 videri,
quadripedes quoque quo simul ac vestigia primum
intulerint, graviter vis cogat concidere ipsa,

manibus ut si sint divis mactata repente.

omnia quae naturali ratione geruntur, 760
et quibus effiant causis apparet origo;

ianua ne forte his Orci regionibus esse

credatur, post 111110 animas Acheruntis in oras

ducere forte deos manis inferne reamur,

naribus alipedes ut cervi saepe putantur 765
ducere de latebris serpentia saecla ferarum.

quod procul a vera quam sit ratione repulsum

percipe 3 nam de re nunc ipsa dicere conor.

is such 3 spot at Cumae, where the mountains are charged with acrid
sulphur, and smoke enriched with hot springs. Such a spot there also
is within the Athenian walls, 011 the very summit of the citadel, beside
the temple of bountiful Tritonian Palla83 which croaking crows never
come near on the wing3 no not when the high altars smoke with offer-
ings: so constantly they fiy not before the sharp wrath of Pallas for the
sake of yon vigil kept, as the poets of the Greeks have sung, but the
nature of the place suffices by its own proper power. In Syria too
as well a spot, we are told, is found to exist of such a sort that as soon
as ever even fourfooted beasts have· entered in, its mere natural power
forces them to fall down heavily, just 33 if they were felled in 3 moment
as sacrifices to the manes gods, Now all these things go on by a
natural law, and it is quite plain whence spring the causes from which
they are produced 3 that the gate of Orcus be not haply believed to exist
in such spots ; and next we imagine that the manes gods from beneath
do haply draw souls down from them to the borders of Acheron3 as
wing-footed stags are supposed often by their scent to draw out from
their holes the savage serpent-tribes. How widely opposed to true
reason this is, now learn 3 for now I essay to tell of the real fact.
