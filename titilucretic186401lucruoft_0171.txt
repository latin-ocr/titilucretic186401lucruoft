133 ut nubes 166116 interdum concrescere in alto
cernimus et mundi speciem violare serenam

136 aera mulcentes motU. nam saepe Gigantum
ora volare videntur et umbram ducere late,
interdum magni montes avolsaque saxa 140
montibus anteire et solem succedere praeter,

143 Nunc ea quam facili 613 celeri ratione genantur
perpetuoque fiuant ab rebus lapsaque cedant

 

semper enim summum quicquid de rebus abundat 145
quod iaculentur. et hoc alias cum pervenit in 168,
transit, ut in primis vitrum. sed ubi aspera saxa

aut in materiam ligni pervenit, ibi 16111

scinditur ut nullum simulacrum reddere possit.

at cum splendida quae constant opposta fuerunt 150
densaque, ut in primis speculum est, nil accidit horum3
nam neque, uti vitrum, potis 6813 1316118116, neque autem

Now [I will proceed to shew] with what ease and. celerity they are

outermost surface is ever streaming off from things and admits of being
discharged: when this reaches some things, it passes through them, glass
especially. But when it reaches rough stenes or the matter of wood, it
is then so torn that it cannot give back any idol. But when objects at
once shining and dense have been put in its way, a mirror especially,
none of these results has place: it can neither pass through it, like glass,
nor can 113 be torn either 3 such perfect safety the polished surface minds
to ensure. ln consequence of this idols stream back to us from such ob-
jects 3 and however suddenly at any moment you place any thing opposite
a mirror, an image shews itself: hence you may be sure that thin tex-
