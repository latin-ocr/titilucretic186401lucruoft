Nunc age quo pacto naris adiectus odoris
tangat agam. primum res multas esse necessest
unde fluens volvat varius se fluctus odorum, 675
et fluere et mitti volgo spargique putandumst3
verum aliis alius magis est animantibus aptus
dissimilis propter formas ideoque per auras
mellis apes quamvis longe ducuntur odore,
volturiique cadaveribus, tum fissa serarum 680

ungula quo tulerit gressum permissa canum vis V

ducit, et humanum longe praesentit odorem
Romulidarum arcis servator candidus anser.

pabula ducit et a taetro resilire veneno 685

Now mark me, and I will discuss 13110 way in which the contact of
smell affects the nostrils: and first there must be many things from
which 3 varied flow of smells streams and rolls on3 and we must
suppose that they thus stream and discharge and disperse themselves
among all things alike 3 but one smell fits itself better to one creature,
another to another on account of their unlike shapeS, · and therefore
bees are drawn on by the smell of honey through the air to a very great
distance, and so are vultures by carcasses. Also the far· reaching power
of scent in dogs leads them on whithersoever the cloven hoof of wild
beasts has carried them 111 their course3 and the smell of man is felt far
away by the saviour of the Romans' citadel, the bright white goose.
Thus different scents assigned to different creatures lead each to its
appropriate food and constrain them 10 recoil from nauseous poison, and
in this way the races of beasts are preserved.

Of all these different smells then which strike the nostrils one may
reach to a much greater distance than another 3 though none of them
is carried so far as sound, as voice, to say nothing of things which strike
the eyesight and provoke vision. For in its mazy course each comes

receiving expanso of air,· first because coming out of its depths it with
