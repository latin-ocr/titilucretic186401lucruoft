cum paribus iungi res et discludere mundum

membraque dividere et magnas disponere parteS‚ 445
446 hoc est, a terris altum secernere caelum,

et sorsum mare uti secreto umore pateret,

seorsus item puri secretique aetheris igneS.

Quippe etenim primum terrai corpora quaeque,
propterea quod erant gravia et perplexa, coibant 450
in medio atque imas capiebant omnia sedes3
quae quanto magis inter se perplexa coibant,
tam magis expressere ea quae mare sidera solem

corpore concreto subtexunt nubila caelum.

mighty parts, that is to say, to separate high heaven from earth, and let
the sea spread itself out apart with its unmixed water, and likewise let
the fires of ether spread apart pure and unmixed.

For first the several bodies of earth, because they were heavy and
closely ent-angled, met together in the middle and took up all of them
the lowest positions3 and the more they got entangled and the closer
their union, the more they squeezed out those particles which were to
make up sea stars sun and moon and the walls of the great world. All
th se are of smooth and round seeds and of much smaller elements than
the earth. Therefore the fire-laden ether first burst out from the
different parts of the earth through all the porous openings and lightly
bore off with itself many fires3 much in the same way as we often see,
so soon as the morning light of the beaming sun blushes golden over
the grass jewelled with dew, and the pools and the ever-running rivers
exhale a mist, and even as the earth itself is sometimes seen to smoke ς
and when all these are gathered together alost, then do clouds on high
with a now cohering body weave a covering beneath heaven. In this
