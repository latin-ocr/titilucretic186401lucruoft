corpora multa vaporis et aeris altaque caeli 490
densebant procul a terris fulgentia templa.

sidebant campi, crescebant montibus altis

-ascensus3 neque enim poterant subsidere saxa

nec pariter tantundem omnes succumbere partis,

Sic igitur terrae concreto corpore pondus 495
constitit atque omnis mundi quasi limus in imum
confluxit gravis et subsedit funditus ut faex3
inde mare inde aer inde aether ignifer ipse
corporibus liquidis sunt omnia pura relicta, ῃ
et leviora aliis alia, et liquidissimus aether 500 ὲ
atque levissimus aerias super influit auraS‚
nec liquidum corpus turbantibus aeris auris
commiscet3 sinit haec violentis omnia verti
turbinibus, sinit incertis turbare procelliS,
ipse suos ignis certo fert impete labens 505
nam modice fluere atque uno posse aethera nisu
significat Pontos, mare certo quod fluit aestu
unum labendi conservans usque tenorem.

[Motibus astrorum nunc quae sit causa canamus,

ex utraque polum parti premere aera nobis
dicendum est extraque tenere et claudere utrimque;

the more did those many bodies of heat and air escape and fly ·abroad
and condense far away from earth the high glittering quarters of heaven.
The plains sank down, the high hills grew in elevation ,· for the rocks
could not settle down nor all the parts sink to one uniform level.

Thus then the ponderous mass of earth was formed with close-co-
hering body and all the slime of the world so to speak slid down by its
weight to the lowest point and settled at the bottom like dregs. Then
the sea, then the air, then the fire-laden ether itself, all are left unmixed
with their clear bodies 5 and some are lighter than others, and clearest
and lightest of all ether floats upon the airy currents, and blends not its
clear body with the troubled airs 5 it suffers all these things below to be
upset with furious hurricanes, suffers them to be troubled by wayward
storms3 while it carries along its own fires gliding with a changeless
onward sweep. For that ether may stream on gently and with one
uniform effort the Pontos shews, a sea which streams with a changeless
current, ever keeping due on its uniform gliding course.

Let us now sing what causes the motions of the stars. In the first
place, if the great sphere of heaven revolves, we must say that an air
presses on the pole at each end and confines it on the outside and closes
