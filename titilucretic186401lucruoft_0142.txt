atque 'ideo tanta mutatum putre ruina

conciderit corPUS, penitus quia mota loco sunt 585
fundamenta, foras anima emanante per artus

perque viarum omnis flexuS, in corpore qui sunt

atque foramina? multimodis ut noscere possis
dispertitam animae naturam exisse per artus

et prius esse sibi distractam corpore in ipso, 590
quam prolapsa foras enaret in aeris auras,

quin etiam finis dum vitae vertitur intra,

saepe aliqua tamen e causa labefacta videtur

ire anima ac toto solui de corpore velle

et quasi supremo languescere tempore voltus 595
molliaque exsangui trunco cadere omnia membra.

frame, and that it has been first torn to shreds within the body, ere it
glided forth and swam out into the air. Moreover even while it yet
moves within the confines of life, osten the soul shaken from some cause or
other is seen to wish to pass out and be loosed from the whole body, the
features are seen to droop as at the last hour and all the limbs to sink
flaccid over the bloodless trunk: just as happenS, when the phrase is
used, the mind is in a bad way, or the soul is quite gone; when all is
hurry and every one is anxious to keep from parting the last tie of life 3
for then the mind and the power of the soul are shaken throughout and
both are quite loosened together with the body; so that a cause some-
what more powerful can quite break them up. Why doubt I would
ask that the soul when driven forth out of the body, when in the open
air, feeble as it is, stript of its covering, not only cannot continue
