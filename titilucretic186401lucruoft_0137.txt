quare animum quoque dissolui fateare necessest, 470
quandoquidem penetrant in eum contagia morbi3

nam dolor ac morbus leti fabricator uterquest, ,
multorum exitio perdocti quod sumus ante.

denique quor, hominem cum vini vis penetravit 476
acris et in venas discessit diditus ardor,

consequitur gravitas membrorum, praepediuntur

crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet 1110118,

nant oculi, clamor singultus iurgia gliscunt, 480
et iam cetera de genere hoc quaecumque secuntur,

cur ea sunt, nisi quod vemens violentia vini

conturbare animam consuevit corpore in ipso?

man and its spirit has been infused into and transmitted through his
veins, why is it that a heaviness of the limbs follows along with it, his
legs are hampered as he reels about, his tongue falters, his mind is be-
sotted, his eyes swim, shouting hiccoughing wranglings are rife, together
with all the other usual concomitants, why is all this, if not because the
overpowering violence of the wine is wont to disorder the soul within
the body? But whenever things can be disordered and hampered, they
give token that if a somewhat more potent cause gained an entrance,
they would perish and be robbed of all further existence, Moreover it
often happens that some one constrained by the violence of disease
suddenly drops down before our eyes, as by a stroke of lightning, and
foams at the mouth, moans and shivers through his frame„stiffens his
muscles‚ is racked, gasps for breath fitfully, and wear-ies his 'limbs with
tossing. Sure enough, because the violence of the disease spreads itself
through his frame and disorders him, he foams as he tries to eject his
soul, just as in the salt sea the waters boil with the mastering might of
