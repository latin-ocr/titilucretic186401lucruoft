folliculos ut nunc teretis aestate cicadae

lincunt sponte sua victum vitamque petentes.

tum tibi terra dedit primum mortalia saecla. 805

multus enim calor atque umor superabat in arvis,

hoc ubi quaeque loci regio opportuna dabatur,

crescebant uteri terram radicibus apti;

quos ubi tempore maturo patefecerat aestus

infantum fugiens umorem aurasque petessenS‚ 810

convertebat ibi natura foramina terrae

et sucum venis cogebat fundere apertis

aeriasque simul volucres variantibu' formis, 825

and when the warmth of the infants, flying the wet and craving the air,
had opened these in the fulness of time, nature would turn to that
spot the pores of the earth and constrain it to yield from its opened
veins a liquid most like to milk, even as now-a—days every woman when
she has borne, is filled with sweet milk, because all that current of nutri-
ment streams towards the breasts. To the children the earth would
furnish food, the heat raiment, the grass a bed rich in abundance of soft
down. But the fresh youth of the world would give forth neither severe
colds nor excessivo heats nor gales of great violence 3 for all things
grow and acquire strength in a like proportion.

Wherefore again and again I say the earth with good title has gotten
and keeps the name of mother, since she of herself gave birth to man-
kind and at a time nearly fixed shed forth every beast that ran ges wildly
over the great mountains, and at the same time the fowls of the air with
