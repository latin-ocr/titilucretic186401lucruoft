100 1116 tops of a mountain in each case are to heaven, the more con-v
stantly at this elevation they smoke with the thick darkness of a swarthy
cloud, because, when clouds first form, before the eyes can see them,
11110 38 they are, the winds carry and bring them together 10 1116 highest
summits of a mountain 3 and 11160 31 1381 when a greater mass of them
has gathered together, being now dense they are able 10 make them-
selves visible and 31 1116 83106 11106 they are seen to rise up from the
very top of the mountain into the ether: the very fact of the 0386 3011
0111 8608311008, when we climb high mountains, prove that the regions
which 81161011 up on high are windy. Again clothes hung up on the
shore, when they drink 10 1116 01108108 1001811116, prove that nature
takes up many bodies over the whole 863 38 well. This makes it still
more plain that many bodies may likewise rise up out of the salt heaving
sea 10 31111 10 1116 bulk of clouds; for the two liquids are near akin in
their nature. Again we see mists and steam rise out of all rivers and
at the same time from the earth as well 3 and these forced out like a
breath from these parts are then carried upwards and overcast heaven
with their darkness and make up clouds 00 high 38 they gradually come
together 3 for the heat of starry ether 31 1116 same time presses down 00
