shew what first in their early essays of productiori they resolved to raise
into the borders of light and to give in charge to the wayward winds.
In the beginning the earth gave forth all kinds of herbage and ver-
dant sheen about the hills and over all the plains ς the flowery meadows
glittered with the bright green hue, and to the different trees was given
a strong and emulous desire of growing up into the air with full un-
bridled powers. As feathers and hairs and bristles are first born on the
limbs of four-footed beasts and the body of the strong of wing, thus the
new earth then first put forth grass and bushes‚ and next gave birth to
the races of mortal creatures springing up many in number in many
ways aster diverse fashions. For no living creatures can have dropped
from heaven nor can those belonging to the land have come out of the
salt pools. It follows that with good reason the earth has gotten the
name of mother, since all things have been produced out of the earth.
And many living creatures even now spring out of the earth taking form
by rains and the heat of the sun. It is therefore the less strange if at
that time they spi-ang up more in number and larger in size, having
come to maturity in the infancy of earth and ether. First of all the
race of fowls and the various birds would leave their eggS, hatched
in the springtime, just as now in summer the cicades leave spontaneously
