‘neve aliquid nostri post mortem posse relinqui,

cum corpus simul atque animi natura perempta 40
in sua discessum dederint primordia quaeque.

Dico igitur rerum effigias tenuisque figuras
mittier ab rebus summo de corpore rerum,

51 quae quasi membranae vel cortex nominitandast, 50
quod speciem ac formam similem gerit eius imago
cuiuscumque cluet de corpore fusa vagari.

44 id licet hinc quamvis hebeti cognoscere corde.

54 principio quoniam mittunt in rebus apertis
corpora res multae, partim diffusa solute, 55
robora ceu fumum mittunt ignesque vaporem,

et vituli cum membranas de corpore summo
nascentes mittunt, et item cum lubrica serpens 60

that any part of us is left behind after death, when the body and the
nature of the mind destroyed together have taken their departure into
their several first—beginnings.

I say then that pictures of things and thin shapes are emitted from
things off their surface: these are like films or may each be named a
rind, because each image bears an appearance and form like to the thing
whatever it is from whose body it is shed and wanders forth. This you
may learn however dull of apprehension from what follows. First of all
since among things open to sight many emit bodieS, some in a state of
loose diffusion, like smoke which logs of oak, heat which fires emit3
some of a closer and denser texture, like the gossamer coats which at
times cicades doff in summer, and the films which calves at their birth
cast from the surface of their body, as well as the vesture which the
slippery serpent puts off among the thorns 3 for often we 'see the brambles
enriched with their flying spoils: since these cases occur, a thin image
likewise must be emitted from things off their surface. For why those
films should drop off and withdraw from things rather than films
which are really thin, no reason whatever can be assigned 3 especially
since there are on the surface of things many minute bodies which may
