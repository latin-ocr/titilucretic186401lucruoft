dummodo ne totum corrumpas luminis orbem 410

et circum caedas aciem solamque relinquas;

id quoque enim sine pernicie non fiet eorum.

destroy the whole ball of the eye and pare close round the pupil and
leave only it 3 for that will not be done without dcstroying the eyes.
But if that middle portion of the eye, small as it is, is eaten into, the
sight is gone at once and darkness ensueS, though a man have the bright

Now mark me: that you may know that the minds and light souls
of living creatures have birth and are mortal, Ι will go on to set forth
verses worthy of your attention got together by long study and invented
with welcome effort. Do you mind to attach to either of the two either
name, and when for instance Ι shall choose to speak of the soul, showing
it to be mortal‚ believe that Ι speak of the mind as well, inasmuch as
