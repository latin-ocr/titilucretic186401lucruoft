et quasi densendo subtexit caerula nimbis,
fit quoque ut huc veniant in caelum extrinsecus illa
corpora quae faciunt nubis nimbosque volantis3
innumerabilem enim numerum summamque profundi 485
esse infinitam docui, quantaque volarent
corpora mobilitate ostendi quamque repente
inmemorabile per spatium transire solerent.
haut igitur mirumst si parvo tempore saepe
tam magnis nimbis tempestas atque tenebrae 490
coperiunt maria ac terras inpensa superne,
undique quandoquidem per caulas aetheris omnis
et quasi per magni circum spiracula mundi
exitus introitusque elementis redditus extat.

N unc age, quo pacto pluvius concrescat in altis 495
nubibus umor et in terras demissus ut imber
decidat, expediam. primum iam semina aquai
multa simul vincam consurgere nubibus ipsis
omnibus ex rebus pariterque ita crescere utrumque
et nubis et aquam quaecumque in nubibus extat, 500
ut pariter nobis corpus cum sanguine crescit,
sudor item atque umor quicumque est denique membris,
concipiunt etiam multum quoque saepe marinum
umorem, veluti pendentia vellera lanae,

them and by condensing as it were weaves a web of clouds below its
blue expanse. Sometimes there come here into heaven from without
those bodies which form clouds and the flying storm-rack3 for I have
shewn that their number passes numbering and that the sum of the deep
is infinite ; and I have proved with what velocity bodies-fiy and how in
a moment of time they are wont to pass through space unspeakable. It
is not therefore strange that a tempest and darkness often in a short
time cover over with such great storm-clouds seas and lands, as they
hang down upon them overhead, since on all sides through all the cavi-
ties of ether and as it were through the vents of the great world around
the power of going out and coming in is accorded to the elementa

Now mark and Ι will explain in what way the rainy moisture is
formed in the clouds and then is sent down and falls to the earth in the
shape of rain. And first I will prove that many seeds of water rise up
together with the clouds themselves out of all things and that both the
clouds and the water which is in the clouds thus increase together3 just
as our body increases together with the blood, as well as the sweat and
all< the moisture which is in the fname. The clouds likewise imbibe
much sea-water as well, like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds
