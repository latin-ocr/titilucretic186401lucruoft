vis et servorem mirum concinnat in undis3

versabundus enim turbo descendit et illam

deducit pariter lento cum corpore nubem3

quam simul ac gravidam detrusit ad aequora ponti, 440

ille in aquam subito totum se inmittit et omne

excitat ingenti sonitu mare fervere cogens,

fit quoque ut involvat venti se nubibus ipse

vertex conradens ex aere semina nubis

et quasi demissum caelo prestera imitetur. 445

hic ubi se in terras demisit dissoluitque,

turbinis inmanem vim provomit atque procellae.

sed quia fit raro omnino montisque necessest

officere in terriS‚ apparet crebrius idem

prospectu maris in magno caeloque patenti. 450
Nubila concrescunt, ubi corpora multa volando

hoc supero in caeli spatio coiere repente

asperiora, moris quae possint indupedita

exiguis tamen inter se comprensa teneri.

haec faciunt· primum parvas consistere nubes; 455

inde haee comprendunt inter se conque gregantur

et coniungendo crescunt ventisque feruntur

usque adeo donec tempestas saeva coortast.

a wondrous boi-ling in the waters ς, for the whirling eddy descende and
brings down together with it yon cloud of limber body 5 and as soon as
it has forced it down full-charged as it is to the levels of the sea, the
eddy in a moment plunges itself entire into the water, and stirs up the
whole sea with a prodigious noise and forces it to boil. Sometimes too
the eddy of wind wraps itself up in clouds and gathers out of the air
seeds of cloud and imitates in a sort the prester let down from heaven.
When this prester has let itself down to the land and has burst, it
belches forth a whirlwind and storm of enormous violence 3 but as it
seldom takes place at all and as mountains cannot but obstruet it on
land, it is seen more frequently on the sea with its wide prospect and
unobstructed horizon.

Olouds are formed, when in this upper space of heaven many bodies
fly ing about have in some one instant met together, of a rougher sort,
such as are able, though they have got the very slightest holds of each
other, to catch together and be held in union. These bodies first cause
small clouds to form 3 and these next catch together and collect into
masses and increase by joining with each other and are carried on by
the winds continually until a fierce storm has gathered. *The nearer
