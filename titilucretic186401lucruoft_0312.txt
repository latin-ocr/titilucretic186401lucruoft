Cetera quae sorsum crescunt sorsumque creantur,
et quae concrescunt in nubibUS, omnia, prorsum
omnia, nix venti grando gelidaeque pruinae
et vis magna geli, magnum duramen aquarum, 5 30
et mora quae fluvios passim refrenat euntiS,
perfacilest tamen haec reperire animoque videre
omnia quo pacto fiant quareve creentur,
cum bene cognoris elementis reddita quae sint.

Nunc age quae ratio terrai motibus extet 5 35
percipe. et in primis terram fac ut esse rearis
supter item ut supera ventosis undique plenam
speluncis multosque lacus multasque lucunas
in gremio gerere et rupes deruptaque saxa3
multaque sub tergo terrai flumina tecta 540
volvere vi fluctus summersaque saxa putandumst3
undique enim similem esse sui res postulat ipsa.

, his igitur rebus subiunctis suppositisque

terra superne tremit magnis concussa ruiniS,
subter ubi ingentis speluncas subruit aetas3 545
quippe cadunt toti montes magnoque repente
concussu late disserpunt inde tremores

et merito, quoniam plaustri concussa tremescunt

As to the other things which grow by themselves and are formed by Î‡
themselves, as well as the things which are formed within the clouds,
all, without exception all, snow winds hail and cold hoarfrosts and the
,great force of ice, the great eongealfflg power of waters, and the stop
which everywhere curbs running rivers, it is yet most easy to find out
and apprehend in mind how all these things take place and in what way
they are formed, when you have fully understood the properties assigned
to elements.

Now mark and learn what the law of earthquakes is. And first of
all take for granted that the earth below us as well as above is filled in
all parts with windy caverns and bears within its bosom many lakes and
many chasms, cliffs and eraggy rocks 3 and you must suppose that many
rivers hidden beneath the crust of the earth roll on with violence waves
and submerged stones 3 for the very nature of the case requires it to be
throughout like to itself. With such things then attached and placed
below, the earth quakes above from the shock of great falling masses,
when underneath time has undermined vast caverns 3 whole mountains
indeed fall in, and in an instant from the mighty shock tremblings
spread themselves far and wide from that centre. And with good cause,
