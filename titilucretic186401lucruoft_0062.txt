50 , 1

temporis ut puncto nil extet reliquiarum
desertum praeter spatium et primordia caeca. 1 1 10
nam quacumque prius de parti corpora desse
constitueS, haec rebus erit pars ianua leti,
hac se turba foras dabit omnis materiai.
Haeo sei pernoseeS, parva perductus opella

namque alid ex alio clarescet nec tibi caeca 1115
nox iter eripiet quin ultima naturai
pervideas: ita res accendent lumina rebus

not a wrack should be left behind, nothing save untenanted space and
viewless first-beginnings. For on whatever side you shall first determine
first bodies to be wanting, this side will be the gate of death for things,
through this the whole crowd of matter will fling itself abroad.

If you will well learn these things, then carried to the end with
slight trouble [you will be able by yourself to understand all the rest]
For one thing after another will grow clear and dark night will not rob
you of the road, to keep you from surveying the utmost ends of nature:
in such wise things will light the torch for other things.
