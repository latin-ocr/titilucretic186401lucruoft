cogit, adeS, paucis dum versibus expediamus
esse ea quae solido atque aeterno corpore constent, 500
semina quae rerum primordiaque esse docemus,
unde omnis rerum nunc constet summa creata.
Principio quoniam duplex natura duarum
dissimilis rerum longe constare repertast,
corporis atque loci, res in quo quaeque geruntur, 505
esse utramque sibi per se puramque necessest.
nam quacumque vacat spatium, quod inane vocamuS,
corpus ea non est; qua porro cumque tenet se
corpus, ea vacuum nequaquam constat inane.
sunt igitur solida ac sine inani corpora prima. 510
praeterea quoniam genitis in rebus inanest,
materiem circum solidam constare necessest,
nec res ulla potest vera ratione probari
corpore inane suo celare atque intus habere,
si non, quod cohibet, solidum constare relinquas. 515
id porro nil esse potest nisi materiai
concilium, quod inane queat rerum cohibere.
materies igitur, solido quae corpore constat,
esse aeterna potest, cum cetera dissoluantur.

essent quae loca complerent quaecumque tenerent,

make clear in a few verses that there are such things as consist of
solid and everlasting body, which we teach are seeds of things and first-
beginningS, out of which the whole sum of things which now exists has
been produced.

First of all then since there has been found to exist a twofold and
widely dissimilar nature of two things, that is to say of body and of
place in which things severally go on, each of the two must exist for
and by itself and quite unmixed. For where there is empty space
which we call void, there body is not 3 wherever again body maintains
itself, there empty void no wise exists. First bodies therefore are solid
and without void. Again since there is void in things begotten, solid
matter must exist about this void, and no thing can be proved by true
reason to conceal in its body and have within it void, unless you
choose to allow that that which holds it in is solid. Again that can
be nothing but a union of matter which can keep in the void of things.
Matter therefore, which consists of a solid body, may be everlasting‚
though all things else are dissolved. Moreover if there were no empty
void, the universe would be solid ς unless on the other hand there were
