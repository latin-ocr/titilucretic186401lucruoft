hoc animi demum ratio discernere debet,

nec possunt oculi naturam noscere rerum. 385
proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli.

qua vehimur navi, fertur, cum stare videtur ;

quae manet in statione, ea praeter creditur ire.

et fugere ad puppim colles campique videntur

quos agimus praeter navem velisque volamus, 390
sidera cessare aetheriis adfixa cavernis

cuncta videntur, et adsiduo sunt omnia motu,
quandoquidem longos obitus exorta revisunt,

cum permensa suo sunt caelum corpore claro,

solque pari ratione manere et luna videntur 395
in statione, ea quae ferri res indicat ipsa.

exstantisque procul medio de gurgite montis

classibus inter quos liber patet exitus ingens,

insula conjunctis tamen ex his una videtur.

atria versari et circumcursare columnae 400
usque adeo fit uti pueris videantur, ubi ipsi

desierunt verti, vix ut iam credere possint

non supra sese ruere omnia tecta minari.

iamque rubrum tremulis iubar ignibus erigere alte

cum coeptat natura supraque extollere montes 405

the reason of the mind, and only it, has to determine 3 nor can the eyes
know the nature of things. Do not then impute to the eyes this frailty
of the mind. The ship in which we are sailing, moves on, while seem-

be passing by. The hills and fields seem to be dropping aster-n, past
which we are driving our ship and fiying under sail. The stars all
seem to be at rest fast fixed to the ethereal vaults‚ and yet are all
in constant motion, since they rise and then go back to their far-off
places of setting, after they have traversed the length of heaven with
their bright bodies. In like manner sun and moon· seem to stay in one
place, bodies which simple fact proves are carried on. And though
between mountains rising up afar off from amid the waters there opens
out for fleets a free passage of wide extent, yet a single island seems to
be formed out of them united into one. When children have stopped
turning round themselves, the halls appear to them to whirl about and
the pillars to course round to such a degree, that they can scarce believe
that the whole roof is not threatening to tumble down upon them. And
when nature begins to raise on high the sun's beam yet ruddy with
bickering fires and to lift it up above the mountains, those hills
