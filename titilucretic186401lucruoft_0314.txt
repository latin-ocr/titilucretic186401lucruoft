et quasi collecti redeunt ceduntque repulsi, -

saepius hanc ob rem minitat-ur terra ruinas

quam facit3 inclinatur enim retroque recellit

et recipit prolapsa suas in pondere sedes

hac igitur ratione vacillant omnia tecta, 575

Est haec eiusdem quoque magni causa tremoris,
ventus ubi atque animae subito vis maxima quaedam
aut extrinsecus aut ipsa tellure coorta

than the bottom, the bottom in a very very slight degree.

The same great quaking likewise arises from this cause, when on a
sudden the wind and some enormous force of air gathering either from
without or within the earth have flung themselves into the cavities of
the earth, and there chafe at first with much uproar among the great
caverns and are carried on with a whirling motion, and when their force
afterwards stirred and lashed into fury bursts abroad and at the same
moment cleaves the deep earth and opens up a great yawning chasm.
This fell out in Syrian Sidon and took place at Aegium in the Pelopon-
nese two towns which an outbreak of wind of this sort and the ensuing
earthquake threw down. And many walled places besides fell down by
great commotions on land and many towns sank down engulphed in the
sea together with their burghers. And if they do not break out, still the
impetuous fury of the air and the fierce violence of the wind spread over
