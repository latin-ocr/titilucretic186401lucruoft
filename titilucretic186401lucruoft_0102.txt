quippe videre licet vivos existere vermes
stercore de taetrO, putorem cum sibi nacta est
intempestivis ex imbribus umida tellus3
praeterea cunctas itidem res vertere sese.
vertunt se fluvii frondes et pabula laeta 875
in pecudeS‚ vertunt pecudes in corpora nostra
naturam, et nostro de corpore saepe ferarum
augescunt vires et corpora pennipotentum.
ergo omnes natura cibos in corpora viva
vertit et hinc sensus animantum procreat omnes, 880
non alia longe ratione adque arida ligna
