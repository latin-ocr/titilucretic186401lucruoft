contendunt neque posse e terris in loca caeli
reccidere inferiora magis quarn corpora nostra
sponte sua possint in caeli templa volare 3
illi cum videant solem, nos sidera noctis 1065
cernere, et alternis nobiscum tempora caeli
dividere et noctes parilis agitare diebus,
sed vanus stolidis haec
amplexi quod habent perv
nam medium nil esse potest 1070
infinita. neque omninO, si iam medium sit,
possit ibi quicquam consistere
quam quavis alia longe ratione
omnis enim locus ac spatium quod inane vocamus
per medium per non medium, concedere debet 1075
aeque ponderibUS, motus quacumque feruntur.
nec quisquam locus est, quo corpora cum venerunt,
ponderis amissa vi possint stare in inani3
nec quod inane autem est ulli subsistere debet,
quin, sua quod natura petit, concedere pergat. 1080
haud igitur possunt tali ratione teneri
res in concilio medii cuppedine victae.
Praeterea quoniam non omnia corpora fingunt
in medium niti, sed terrarum atque liquoriS,

that living things walk head downwards and cannot tumble out of earth
into the parts of heaven lying below them any more than our bodies can
spontaneously fly into the quarters of heaven 3 that when those 500 the
sun, we behold the stars of night 3 and that they share with us time
about the seasons of heaven and pass nights equal in length to our days.
But groundless [error has devised such dreams] for fools, because they
have embraced [false principles of reason] For there 0011 be no centre
[where the universe is] infinite3 no nor, even if there were 0 centre,
could anything take up a position there [any more on that account] than
for some quite different reason [be driven away] · For all room and space,
which we term void, must through centre, through no-centre alike give
place to heavy bodies, in whatever directions their motions tend. Nor
is there any spot of such a sort that when bodies have reached it, they
can lose their force of gravity and stand upon void 3 and that again
which is void must not serve to support anythin g, but must, as its na-
ture craves, continually give place. Things cannot therefore in such a
way be held in union, o’ermastered by love of a centre.

Again since they do not suppose that 011 bodies press to the centre,
