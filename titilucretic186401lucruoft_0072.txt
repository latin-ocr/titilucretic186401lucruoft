respuat umor aquan nam quo magis ursimus alte

deiecta et magna vi multi pressimus aegre,

tam cupide sursum revomit magis atque remittit,

plus ut parte foras emergant exiliantque. 200

nec tamen haec, quantum est in se, dubitamus, opinor,

quin vacuum per inane deorsum cuncta ferantur.

,810 igitur debent fiammae quoque posse per auras

aeris expressae sursum succedere, quamquam

pondera, quantum in sest, deorsum, deducere pugnent, 205

nocturnasque faces caeli sublime volantis

nonne vides longos flammarum ducere tractus

See you not too with what force the liquid of water spits out logs and
beams‘l the more we have pushed and forced them deep down and have
pressed them in, many of 118 together, with all our might and much
painful effort, with the greater avidity it vomits them up and casts them
forth, so tha-t they rise and start out more than half their length. And
yet methinks we doubt not that these, so far as in them is, are all borne
downwards through the empty void. In the 861110 way flames also ought
to be able, when squeezed out, to mount upward through the air, 61-
though their weights‚ so far 68 111 them 18, strive to draw them down.
See you not too that the nightly meteors of heaven as they fly aloft
draw after them long trails of flames in whatever direction nature has
given them a passage? Do you not perceive stars and meteors fall to
the earth? The sun also from the height of heaven sheds its heat on
all sides and sows the fields with light 3 to the earth therefore 68 well
the Sun’s heat tends. Lightnings also you see fly athwart the rains:
now from this side now from that fires burst from the clouds and rush
about3 the force of flame falls to the earth all round.

This point too herein we wish you to apprehend: when bodies are
borne downwards sheer through void, at quite uncertain times and
