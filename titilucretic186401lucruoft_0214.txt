oris et inspirant pressantes dentibus ora,

nequiquam, quoniam nil inde abradere possunt 1110
nec penetrare et abire in corpus corpore toto;

nam facere interdum velle et certare videntur:

usque adeo cupide in Veneris compagibus haerent,

membra voluptatis dum vi labefacta liquescunt.

tandem ubi se erupit nervis conlecta cupido, 1115

parva fit ardoris violenti pausa parumper.

inde redit rabies eadem et furor ille revisit,

cum sibi quid cupiant ipsi contingere quaerunt,

nec reperire malum id possunt quae machina vincat:

usque adeo incerti tabescunt volnere caecO. 1120
Adde quod absumunt viris pereuntque labore,

interdum in pallam atque alideusia Ciaque vertunt. 1130

. chains of Venus, while their limbs melt overpowered by the might of

the pleasure. At length when the gathered desire has gone forth, there
ensues for a brief while a short pause in the burning desire 3 and then
returns the same frenzy, then comes back the old madness, when they
are at a loss to know what they really desire to get, and cannot find
what device is to conquer that mischief ε 111 such utter uncertainty they
pine away by a hidden wound.

Then too they waste their strength and ruin themselves by the
labour, then too their life is passed at the beck of another. Meanwhile
their estate runs away and is turned into Babylonian coverlets3 duties
are neglected and their good name staggers and sickens. On her feet
laugh elastic and beautiful Sicyonian shoes, yes, and large emeralds with
green light are set in gold and the sea-coloured dress is worn constantly
and much used drinks in the sweat. The noble earnings of their fathers
are turned into hair-hands, head-dresses 3 sometimes are changed into a.
sweeping robe and alideusian and Cean dresses. Feasts set out with
