dissolui simul ac defecit suppeditare 1040
materies aliqua ratione aversa viai.
nec plagae possunt extrinsecus undique summam
conservare omnem quaecumque est conciliata.
cudere enim crebro possunt partemque morari,
dum veniant aliae ac suppleri summa queatur. 104 5
interdum resilire tamen coguntur et una
principiis rerum spatium tempusque fugai
largiri, ut possint a coetu libera ferri.
quare etiam atque etiam suboriri multa necessest,
et tamen ut plagae quoque possint suppetere ipsae, 1050
infinita opus est vis undique materiai.

Illud in 1118 rebus longe fuge credere, Memmi,
in medium summae, quod dicunt, omnia niti,
atque ideo mundi naturam stare sine ullis
ictibus externis neque quoquam posse resolvi 105 5
summa atque ima, quod in medium sint omnia nixa:
ipsum si quicquam posse in se sistere credis:
et quae pondera sunt sub terris omnia sursum
nitier in terraque retro requiescere posta,
ut per aquas quae nunc rerum simulacra videmus. 1060
et simili ratione animalia suppa vagari

to be supplied, diverted 111 any way from its proper course. Nor can
blows from without hold together all the sum which has been brought
into union. They can it is true frequently impinge upon and stay a
part, until others come and the sum can be completed. At times how-
ever they are compelled to rebound and in so doing grant to the first-
beginnings of things room and time for flight, to enable them to get clear
away from the mass in union. Wherefore again and again I repeat many
bodies must rise up 3 nay more that the blows themselves may not fail,
there is need of an infinite supply of matter on all sides.

And 11010111, Memmius, be far from believing 131118, that all things
as· they say press to the centre of the sum, and that for this reason
the nature of the world stands fast without any strokes from the outside
and the uppermost and lowest parts cannot part asunder in any direc-
tion, because all things have been always pressing towards the centre
(if you can believe that anything can rest upon itself); or that the heavy
bodies which are beneath the earth all press upwards and are at rest
on the earth, turned topsyturvy, just like the images of things which
we see before us in the waters. In the same way too they maintain
