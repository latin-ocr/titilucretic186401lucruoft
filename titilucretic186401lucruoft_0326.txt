frigidior porro in puteis aestate fit umor, 840
rarescit quia terra calore et semina siquae
forte vaporis habet, propere dimittit in auraS,
quo magis est igitur tellus effeta calore,
fit quoque frigidior qui in terrast abditus umor.

Esse apud Hammonis fanum fons luce diurna

this spot, at once the buoyant force of their pinions is crippled and ren-
dered vain and all the sustaining efforts of their wings are lost on both
sides. So when they are unable to buoy themselves up and lean upon
their wings, nature, you know, compels them by their weight to tumble
down to earth, and lying stark through what is now almost a void they
disperse their souls through all the openings of their body. >xe 21< Again
during summer the water in wells becomes colder, because the earth is
rarefied by heat and sends out into the air whatever seeds of its own
proper heat it happens to have. The more then the earth is drained of
heat, the colder becomes the water which is hidden in the earth. Again
when all the earth is compressed by cold and contracts and so to say
congeals, it then, you are to know, while it contracts, presses out into
the wells whatever heat it contains itself.

At the fane of Hammon there is said to be a fountain which is cold
in the daylight and hot in the night-time. This fountain men marvel at
exceedingly and suppose that it suddenly becomes hot by the influence
of the fierce sun below the earth, when night has covered the earth with
awful darkness. But this is far far removed from true reason„ Why
when the sun though in, contact with the uncovered body of the water
