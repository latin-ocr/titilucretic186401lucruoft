ventorum validis fervescunt viribus undae.

exprimitur porro gemitus quia membra dolore 49 5
adficiuntur et omnino quod semina vocis

eiciuntur et ore foras glomerata feruntur

qua quasi consuerunt et sunt munita viai,

desipientia fit, quia vis animi atque animai

conturbatur et, ut docui, divisa seorsum 500
disiectatur eodem illo distracta venenO.

inde ubi iam morbi reflexit causa reditque

in latebras acer corrupti corporis umor,

tum quasi vaccillans primum consurgit et omnis
paulatim redit in sensus animamque receptat. 505
haec igitur tantis ubi morbis corpore in ipso

iactentur miserisque modis distracta laborent,

cur eadem credis sine corpore in aere aperto

cum validis ventis aetatem degere posse?

et quoniam mentem sanari, corpus ut aegrum, 510
cernimus et flecti medicina posse videmuS,

id quoque praesagit mortalem vivere mentem.

addere enim partis aut ordine traiecere aecumst

aut aliquid prosum de summa detrahere hilum,
commutare animum quicumque adoritur et infit 515

pain, and mainly because seeds of voice are driven forth and are carried
in a close mass out by the mouth, the road which they are accustomed
to take and where they have a well-paved way. Loss of reason follows,
because the powers of the mind and soul are disordered and, as I have
shewn, are riven and forced asunder, torn to pieces by the same baneful
malady. Then after the cause of the disease has bent its course back
and the acrid humours of the distempered body return to their hiding-
places, then he first gets up like one reeling, *and by little and little
comes back into full possession of his senses and regains his 80111. Since
therefore even within the body mind and soul are hai-assed by such
violent distempers and so miserably racked by sufferings, why believe
that they without the body in the open air can continue existence
battling with fierce winds‘l And since we perceive that the mind is
healed, like the sick body, and we see that it can be altered by medicine,
this too gives warning that the mind has a mortal existence. For it is
natural that whosoever essays and attempts to change the mind or seeks
to alter any other nature you like, should add new parts or change the
arrangement of the present, or at least withdraw some small fraction
from the whole sum. But that which is immortal wills not to have its
