et tamen hoc quoque uti concedam scire, at id ipsum
quaeram, cum in rebus veri nil viderit ante,

unde sciat quid sit scire et nescire vicissim, 475
notitiam veri quae res falsique crearit

et dubium certo quae res differre probarit.

invenies primis ab sensibus esse creatam

notitiem veri neque sensus posse refelli.

nam maiore fide debet reperirier illud, 480
sponte sua veris quod possit vincere falsa.

quid maiore fide porro quam sensus haberi

debet? an ab sensu salso ratio orta valebit

dicere eos contra, quae tota ab sensibus orta est?

qui nisi sunt veri, ratio quoque falsa fit omnis 485
an poterunt oculos aures reprehendere, an aures

tactus? an hunc porro tactum sapor arguet oris,

an confutabunt nares oculive revincent?

non, ut opinor, ita est. nam seorsum cuique potestas
divisast, sua vis cuiquest, ideoque necesse est 490
et quod molle sit et gelidum fervensve seorsum

et seorsum varios rerum sentire colores

et quaecumque colon'bu’ sint coniuncta videre.

seorsus item sapor oris habet vim, seorsus odores

head where his feet should be. And yet granting that he knows this, I
would still put this question, since he has never yet seen any truth in
things whence 116 knows what knowing and not knowing severally are,
and what it is that has produced the knowledge of the true and the false
and what has proved ‘the doubtful toffiffer from the certain. You will
find that from the senses first has proceeded the knowledge of the true
and that the 8611868 cannot be refuted. For then that something ought
to be discovered which is of greater credit than they, able of itself to
refute things false by true things. Well then what can fairly be
accounted worthy of greater credit than sense? Shall reason founded
on false sense be able to contradict them, wholly founded as it is on the
senses‘l and if they are not true, then all reason as well is rendered
false. Or shall the ears be able to take the eyes to task, or the touch
the ears? Again shall the taste call in question this touch, or the
nostrils refute or the eyes controvert it ’1μ Not so I guess; for each
apart has its own distinct office, each its own power 3 and therefore we
must perceive what is soft and cold or hot by one distinct faculty, by
another perceive the different colours of things and see all the qualities
conjoined with colour. Taste too has its faculty apart3 smells spring
