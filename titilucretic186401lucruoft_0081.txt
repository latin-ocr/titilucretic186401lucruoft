iucundo sensu linguae tractentur in ore;
at contra taetra absinthi natura ferique 400
centauri foedo pertorquent ora sapore3
ut facile agnoscas e levibus atque rutundis
esse ea quae sensus iucunde tangere possunt,
at contra quae amara atque aspera cumque videntur,
haec magis hamatis inter se nexa teneri 405
proptereaque solere vias rescindere nost-ris

semine constituaS‚ oculos qui pascere possunt,
et qui conpungunt aciem lacrimareque cogunt 420

for this reason are wont to tear open passages into our senses and in

entering in to break through the body.

All things in short which are agreeable to the senses and all which
are unpleasant to the feeling are mutually repugnant, formed as they
are out of an unlike first shape 3 lest haply you suppose that the harsh
grating of the creaking saw consists of elements as smooth as those of
tuneful melodies which musicians wake into life with nimble fingers and
give shape to on strings 3 or suppose that the first-beginnings are of like
shape which pass into the nostrils of men, when noisome carcasses are
burning, and when the stage is fresh sprinkled with Cilician saffron,
while the altar close by exhales Panchaean odours; or decide that the
pleasant colours of things which are able to feast the eyes are formed
of a seed like to the seed of those which make the pupil smart and force
