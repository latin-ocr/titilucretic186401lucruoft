scilicet esse globosa tamen, cum squalida constent,
provolvi simul ut possint et laedere sensus 470
et quo mixta putes magis aspera levibus esse
principiiS, unde est Neptuni corpus acerbum,
est ratio secernendi3 seorsumque videndi
umor dulcis, ubi per terras crebrius idem

linquit enim supera taetri primordia viri,
aspera quom magis in terris haerescere possint.

Quod quoniam docui, pergam conectere rem quae
ex hoc apta fidem ducat, primordia rerum
finita variare figurarum ratione, 480
quod si non ita sit, rursum iam semina quaedam

nam quoniam eadem una cuiusvis in brevitate
corporis inter se multum variare figurae

pains3 and yet they must not be hooked so as to hold together: you
are to know that though rough, they are yet spherical‚ so that while
they roll freely on, they may at the same time hurt the senseS. And
that you may more readily believe that with smooth are mixed rough
first-beginnings from which N eptune's body is made bitter, there is a
way of separating these, and of seeing apart how the fresh water, when
it is often filtered through the earth, fiows into a trench and sweetens ;
for it leaves above the first-beginnings of the nauseous saltness, inas-
much as the rough part-icles can more readily stay behind in the earth.
And now that I have shewn this, I will go on to link to it a truth
.which depends on this and from this draws its proof : the first—beginnings
of things have different shapes, but the number of shapes is finite. If
this were not so, then once more it would follow that some seeds must
be of infinite bulk of body. For since in one and the same small size.
of any first body you like the shapes cannot vary much from one ano-
ther:—say for instance that first bodies consist of three least parts, or
augment them by a few more 3 when to wit in all possible ways, by
placing each in turn at the top and at the bottom, by making the right
change places with the left, you shall have tried all those parts of one'
