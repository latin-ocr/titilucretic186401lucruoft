multa videbis enim plagis ibi percita caecis
commutare viam retroque repulsa reverti 1 30
nunc hue nunc illuc in cunctas undique partis,
scilicet hic a principiis est omnibus error.
prima moventur enim per se primordia rerum;
inde ea quae parvo sunt corpora conciliatu
et quasi proxima sunt ad viris principiorum, 13 5
ictibus illorum caecis inpulsa cientur,
ipsaque proporro paulo maiora lacessunt.
sic a principiis ascendit motus et exit
paulatim nostros ad 88118118, ut moveantur
illa quoque, in solis quae lumine cernere quimus 140
nec quibus id faciant plagis apparet aperte.
Nunc quae mobilitas sit reddita materiai
corporibus paucis licet hinc cognoscere, Memmi.
primum aurora novo cum spargit lumine terras
et variae volucres nemora avia pervolitantes 145
aera per tenerum liquidis loca vocibus opplent,
quam subito soleat sol ortus tempore tali
convestire sua* perfundens omnia luce,
omnibus in promptu manifestumque esse videmus,
at vapor is quem sol mittit lumenque serenum 150
non per inane meat vacuum; quo tardius ire

‘you will observe many things there impelled by unseen blows to change τ
their course and driven back to return the way they came now this way
now that way in all directions round. All 'you are to know derive this
restlessness from the first-beginnings. For the first-beginnings of things
move first of themselves 3 next those bodies which form a small ‘aggregate
and come nearest so to say to the powers of the first-beginnings‚ are im-
peUed and set in movement by the unseen strokes of those first bodies,
and they in turn stir up bodies which are a little larger. Thus motion
mounts up from the first-beginnings and step by step issues forth to our
senses, so that those bodies also move, which we can discern 111 the sun-
light, though it is not clearly seen by what blows they so act.

Now what velocity is given to bodies of matter, you may apprehend,
Memmius, in few words from this: when morning first sprinkles the
earth with fresh light and the different birds ffitting about the pathless
woods through the buxom air fill all places with their clear notes, we
see it to be plain and evident to all how suddenly the sun after rising
is wont ,at such a time to overspread all things and clothe them with
his light. But that heat which the sun emits and that bright light pass
not through empty void3 and therefore they are forced to travel more
