aut alio in quovis uno puroque nitore
dissimiles longe inter se variosque colores,
praeterea nil officiunt obstantque figurae
dissimiles quo quadratum minus omne sit extra3 785
at varii rerum inpediunt prohibentque colores
quominus esse uno possit res tota nitore.

Tum porro quae ducit et inlicit ut tribuamus
principiis rerum nonnumquam causa coloreS,
occidit, ex albis quoniam non alba creantur, 790
nec quae nigra cluent de nigris sed variis ex,
quippe etenim multo proclivius exorientur

Then too the reason which leads and draws us on sometimes to
assign colours to the first-beginnings of things, falls to the ground, since*
white things are not produced from white, nor those which are black
from black, but out of things of various colours. For white things will
much more readily rise up and be born from no colour than from a
white or any other colour which thwarts and opposes it.

Moreover since colours cannot exist without light and first-begin-
nings of things do not come out into the light, you may be sure they
are clothed with no colour. For what colour can there be in total
darkness? nay it changes in the light itself according as its brightness
comes from a straight or slanting stroke of light. After this fashion
the down which encircles and crowns the nape and throat of doves
shows itself in the sun: at one time it is ruddy with the hue of bright
pyropus 3 at another it appears by a certain way of looking at it to
