01 nunc per maria ac terras sublimaque caeli 340
multa modis multis varia ratione moveri

cernimus ante 0011105, quae, si non esset inane,

non tam sollicito motu privata carerent

quam genita omnino nulla ratione fuissent,

undique materies quoniam stipata quiesset. 345
praeterea quamvis solidae res esse putentur,

heights of heaven we see before our eyes many things move in many
ways for various reasons, which things», if there were no void, I need not
say would lack and want restless motion: they never would have been
begotten at all, since matter jammed on all sides would have been at
rest. Again however solid things are thought to be, you may yet learn
from this that they are of rare body: in rocks and caverns the moisture
of water oozes through and 011 things weep with abundant drops. Food
distributes itself through the whole body of living things 3 trees grew
and yield fruit in season because food is diffused through the whole from
the very roots over the stem and all the boughs. Voices pass through
walls and fly through houses shut, stiffening frost pierces to the bones.
Now if there 010 110 void parts, by what way can the bodies severally
