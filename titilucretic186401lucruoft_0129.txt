III 117

est et frigida multa comes formidinis aura 290
quae ciet horrorem membris et concitat artus3

est etiam quoque pacati status aeris ille,

pectore tranquillo qui fit voltuque sereno,

sed calidi plus est illis quibus acria corda

iracundaque mens facile effervescit in ira. 295
quo genere in primis vis est violenta leonum,

pectora qui fremitu rumpunt plerumque gementes

nec capere irarum fluctus in pectore possunt.

at ventosa magis cervorum frigida mens est

et gelidas citius per viscera concitat auras 300
quae tremulum faciunt membris existere motum.

at natura boum placido magis aere vivit,

nec nimis irai fax umquam subdita percit

fumida, suffundens caecae caliginis umbra,

nec gelidis torpet telis perfixa pavoris: 305
inter utrosque sitast, cervos saevosque leones.

sic hominum genus est. quamvis doctrina politos
constituat pariter quosdam, tamen illa relinquit

naturae cuiusque animi vestigia prima.

nec radicitus evelli mala posse putandumst, 310
quin proclivius hic iras decurrat ad acria

ille metu citius paulo temptetur, at ille

comrade of fear, which spreads a shivering over the limbs and stirs the
whole frame 3 yes and there is also that condition of still air which has
place when the breast is calm and the looks cheerful. But they have
more of the hot whose keen heart and passionate mind lightly boils up
in anger. Foremost in this class comes the fierce violence of lions who “
often as they chafe break their hearts with their roaring and cannot
contain within their breast the billows os their rage. Then the chilly
mind of stags is fuller of the spirit and more quickly rouses through all
the flesh its icy currents which spread over the limbs a shivering motion.
But the nature of oxen has its life rather from the still air, and never

does the smoky torch of anger applied to it stimulate it too much, shed- y Ι ¹ ,Α

ding over it the shadow of fiiirky gloom, nor is it transfixed and stiffened
by the icy shafts of fear ε 11, lies between the other two, stags and cruel
lions. And thus it is with mankind : however much teaching renders
some equally refined, it yet leaves behind the earliest traces of the nature
of each mind3 and we are not to suppose that evil habits can be so
thoroughly plucked up by the roots, that one inan shall not be more
prone than another to keen anger, a second shall not be somewhat more
