hinc porro quamvis animantem ex omnibus unam
ossa cruor venae calor umor viscera nervi 670

670 constituunt; quae sunt porro distantia longe,

dissimili perfecta figura principiorum.

tum porro quaecumque igni flammata cremantur,

si nil praeterea, tamen haec in corpore condunt

unde ignem iacere et lumen summittere possint 67 5
675 scintillasque agere ac late differre favillam.

cetera consimili mentis ratione peragrans

invenies igitur multarum semina rerum

corpore celare et varias cohibere figuras

denique multa vides quibus et color et sapor una 680
681 reddita sunt curn odore. in privis pleraque dona

haec igitur variis debent constare figuris3

nidor enim penetrat qua fucus non it in artUS‚

fucus item sorsum, sorsum sapor insinuatur

sensibus3 ut noscas privis differre figuris, 685

dissimiles igitur formae glomeramen in unum

conveniunt et res permixto semine constant.

quin etiam passim nostris in versibus ipsis

multa elementa vides multis communia verbiS,

cum tamen inter se versus ac verba necesse est 690

And hence too any one you please out of the whole number of living
creatures is made up of bones blood veins heat moisture fiesh sinews3
and these things again differ widely from one another and are composed
of elements of dissimilar shape. Fui-thermore whatever things are set

on fire and bul-ned, store up in their body, if nothing else, at least those
particles, out of which they may radiate fire and send out light and
make sparks fly and scatter embers all about. If you will go over
all other things by a like process of reasoning‚ you will thus find that
they conceal in their body the seeds of many things and contain ele-
ments of various shapes. Again you see many things to which are
given at once both colour and taste together with smell. These proper-
ties, as there are several of them in each thing, must therefore be made
up of elements of different shapes 3 for smell enters in where colour
passes not into the frame, colour too in one way, taste in another makes
its way into the senses3 so that you know they differ in the particular
shapes of their elements. Therefore unlike forms unite into one mass
and things are made up of a mixture of seed. Throughout moreover
these very verses of ours you see many elements common to many words,
though yet you must admit that the verses and words one with another

are different and composed of different elements 3 not that but few
