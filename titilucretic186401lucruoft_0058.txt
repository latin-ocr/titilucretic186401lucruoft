copia ferretur magnum per inane soluta,

sive adeo potius numquam concreta creasset

ullam rem, quoniam cogi disiecta nequisset. 1020
nam certe neque consilio primordia rerum

ordine se suo quaeque sagaci mente locarunt

nec quos quaeque darent motus pepiyere profecta

sed quia multa modis multis mutata per omne

ex infinito vexantur percita plagiS, 1025
omne genus motus et coetus experiundo

tandem deveniunt in talis disposituras,

qualibus haec rerum consistit summa creata,

et multos etiam magnos servata per annos

ut semel in motus coniectast convenientis, 1030
efficit ut largis avidum mare fluminis undis

integrent amnes et solis terra vapore

sota novet fetus summissaque gens animantum

floreat et vivant labentes aetheris ignes;

quod nullo facerent pactO, nisi materiai 1035
ex infinito suboriri copia posset,

unde amissa solent reparare in tempore quaeque.

nam veluta privata cibo natura animantum

diffluit amittens corpus sic omnia debent

void, or rather I should say would never have combined to produce any
thing, since scattered abroad it could never have been brought together.
For verily not by design did the first-beginnings of things station them·
selves each in its right place guided by keen-sighted intelligence, nor did
t-hey bargain sooth to say what motions each should assume, but because
many in number and shifting about in many ways throughout the uni-
verse they are driven and tormented by blows during infinite time past,
after trying motions and unions of every kind at length they fall into
arrangements such as those out of wh ich this our sum of things has been
formed, and by which too it is preserved through many great years when
once it has been thrown into the appropriate motions, and causes the
streams to replenish the greedy sea with copious river-waters and the
earth, fostered by the heat of the sun, to renew its produce, and the race
of living things to breed and flourish, and the gliding fires of ether to
live: all which these several things could in no wise bring to pass, unless
a store of matter could rise up from infinite space, out of which store they
are wont to make up in due season whatever has been lost, For as the
nature of living things when robbed of food loses its body and wastes
