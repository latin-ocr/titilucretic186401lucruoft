II 65

Illud in his rebus non est mirabile, quare,
omnia cum rerum primordia sint in motU,
summa tamen summa videatur stare quiete, 310
praeterquam siquid proprio dat corpore motus,
omnis enim longe nostris ab sensibus infra
primorum natura iacet: quapropter, ubi ipsa
cernere iam nequeas motus quoque surpere debent;
praesertim cum, quae possimus cernere, celent 315
saepe tamen motus spatio diducta locorum.
nam saepe in colli tondentes pabula laeta
lanigerae reptant pecudes quo quamque vocantes
invitant herbae gemmantes rore recenti,
et satiati agni ludunt blandeque coruscant3 320
omnia quae nobis longe confusa videntur
et velut in viridi candor consistere colli.
praeterea magnae legiones cum loca cursu
camporum complent belli simulacra cienteS‚
fulgor ibi ad caelum se tollit totaque circum 325
aere renidescit tellus supterque virum vi
excitur pedibus sonitus clamoreque montes
icti reiectant voces ad sidera mundi
et circumvolitant equites mediosque repente
tramittunt valido quatientes impete campos, 330

And herein you need not wonder at this, that though the first-
beginnings of things are all in motion, yet the sum is seen to rest in
supreme repose, unless where a thing exhibits motions with its indivi-
dual body. For all the nature of first things lies far away from our
senses beneath their ken 3 and therefore since they are themselves be-
yond what you can see, they must withdraw from sight their motions
also3 and the more so that the things which we can see, do yet often
conceal their motions when a great distance off. For often the woolly
flocks as they crop the glad pastui-es on a hill, creep on whither the
grass jewelled with fresh dew summons and invites each, and the lambs
fed to the full gambol and playfully butt 3 all which objects appear to
,us from a distance to be blended together and to rest like a white spot
on a green hill. Again when mighty legions fill with their movements
all parts of the plains waging the mimicry of war, the glitter then lists
itself up to the sky and the whole earth round gleams with brass and
beneath a noise is raised by the mighty trampling of men and the moun-
tains stricken by the shouting reecho the voices to the stars of heaven,

2³ and horsemen fly about and suddenly wheeling scour across the middle

ζ of the plains, shaking them with the vehemence of their charge. And
