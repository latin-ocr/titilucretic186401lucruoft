non quierit calidum supera de reddere parte, 855
cum superum lumen tanto fervore fruatur,

qui queat hic supter tam crasso corpore terram
percoquere umorem et calido satiare vapore?

praesertim 011111 vix possit per saepta domorum

insinuare suum radiis ardentibus aestum. 860
quae ratiost igitur? nimirum terra magis quod

rara tepet circum fontem quam cetera tellus

multaque sunt ignis prope semina corpus aquai.

hoc ubi roriferis terram nox obruit 1111111118,

extemplo penitus frigescit terra coitque. 865
hac ratione fit ut, tamquam compressa manu sit,
exprimat in fontem quae semina cumque habet igniS‚
quae calidum faciunt aqiiae tactum atque saporem.

inde ubi sol radiis terram dimovit obortus

et rarefecit calido gliscente vapore, 870
rursus in antiquas redeunt primordia sedes

ignis et in terram cedit calor omnis aquai.

frigidus hanc 011 10111 fit fons in 11100 diurna.

praeterea solis radiis iactatur aquai

has not been able to make it hot 011 118 upper side, though his light
above possesses such great heat‚ how can he below the earth which is of
so dense a body boil the water and glut it with heat? above all when
he can scarcely with his burning rays force his heat through the walls of
houses. What then is the 0311802 11118 81110 enough: the earth is more
porous and warmer round the fountain than the rest of the earth, and
there are many seeds of fire near the body of water. For this reason
when night has buried the earth in its dewy shadows, the earth at once
becomes quite cold and contracts: in this way just as if it were squeezed
by the hand it forces out into the fountain whatever seeds of fire it has 3
and these make the water hot to the touch and taste. Ν ext when the
sun has risen and with his rays has loosened the earth and has rarefied it
as his heat waxes stronger, the first-beginnings of fire return back to
their ancient seats and 311 1110 11031 of the water withdraws into the
earth: for this reason the fountain becomes cold in the daylight. Again
the liquid of water is played upon by the sun’s rays and in the light is
rarefied by his throbbing heat 3 and therefore it gives up whatever seeds of
