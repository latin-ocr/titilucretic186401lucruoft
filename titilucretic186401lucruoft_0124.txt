Is tibi nunc animus quali sit corpore et unde
constiterit pergam rationem reddere dictis,
principio esse aio persuptilem atque minutis
perquam corporibus factum constare. id ita esse 180⁸
hinc licet advertas animum ut pernoscere possis:
nil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur,
quam sibi mens fieri proponit et inchoat ipsa;
ocius ergo animus quam res se perciet ulla,
ante oculos quorum in promptu natura videtur. 185
at quod mobile tanto operest, constare rutundis
perquam seminibus debet perquamque minutiS,
momine uti parvo possint inpulsa moveri.
namque movetur aqua et tantillo momine flutat

quippe volubilibus parvisque creata figuris, 190

I will now go on 130 explain in my verses of what kind of body the

that it is extremely fine and formed of exceedingly minute 11011100. That
this is so you may, if you please to attend, clearly perceive from what
follows: nothing that is 00011 takes place with a velocity equal to that
of the mind when it starts some suggestion and actually sets it agoing;
the mind therefore is stirred with greater rapidity than any of the things
whose nature stands out visible to sight. But that which is 00 passing
nimble, must consist of seeds exoeedingly round and exceedingly minute,
in order to be stirred and set in.motion by a small moving power. Thus
water is moved and heaves by ever so small a force, formed as it is of
small particles apt to roll. But 011 13110 other hand the nature of honey
is more sticky, its liquid more sluggish and its movement more dilatory ;
for the whole mass of matter coheres more closely, because sure enough
it is made of bodies not so smooth fine and round. A breeze however

gentle and light can force, as you may see, a high heap of poppy seed
to be blown away from the top downwards ; but on the other hand
eurus itself cannot move a heap of stones. Therefore bodies possess a,
