‘318 ⁸ VI

perpetuo fluere ac mitti spargique necessest
corpora quae feriant oculos visumque lacessant.
perpetuoque fluunt certis ab rebus odores3
frigus ut a fluviis, calor ab sole, aestus ab undis 925
aequoris exesor moerorum litora propter.
nec varii cessant sonitus manare per auras
denique in os salsi venit umor saepe saporiS,
cum mare versamur propter, dilutaque contra
934 cum tuimur misceri absinthia, tangit amaror. 930
usque adeo omnibus ab rebus res quaeque fluenter
930 fertur et in cunctas dimittitur undique partis
nec mora nec requies interdatur ulla fluendi,
perpetuo quoniam sentimUS, et omnia semper
cernere odorari licet et sentire sonare. 935
936 Nunc omnis repetam quam raro corpore sint res
commemorare3 quod in primo quoque carmine claret.
quippe etenim, quamquam multas hoc pertinet ad res

qua de disserere adgredior, firmare necessest 940 ’
nil esse in promptu nisi mixtum corpus inani.
principio fit ut in speluncis saxa superne
sudent umore et guttis manantibu' stillent.

bodies as strike the eyes and provoke vision. Smells too incessantly
stream from certain things 3 as does cold from rivers, heat from the sun,
spray from the waves of the sea, that eater into walls near the shore.
Various sounds too cease not to stream through the air. Then a moist
salt flavour often comes into the mouth, when we are movingabout
beside the sea3 and when we look on at the mixing of a decoction of
wormwood, its bitterness affects us. In such a constant stream from all
these things the several qualities of things are carried and are trans-
mitted in all directions round, and no delay, no respite in the fiow is
ever granted, since we constantly have feeling, and may at any time see
smell and hear the sound of anything.

And now I will state once again how rare a body all things have: a
question made clear in the first part of my poem also: although the
knowledge ofathis is of importance in regal-d to many things, above all
in regard to this very question which Ι am coming to discuss‚ at the
very outset it is necessary to establish that nothing comes under sense
save body mixed with void. For instance in caves rocks overhead sweat
with moisture and trickle down in oozing drops. Sweat too oozes out
