V 229

>at pater omnipotens ira tum percitus acri

magnanimum Phaethonta repenti fulminis ictu 400
deturbavit equis in terram, solque cadenti

obvius aeternam succepit lampada mundi

disiectosque redegit equos iunxitque trementiS‚

inde suum per iter recreavit cuncta gubernem-5,

scilicet ut veteres Graium cecinere poetae. 405
quod procul a vera nimis est ratione repulsum.

ignis enim superare potest ubi materiai

Greeks sung 3 though it is all too widely at variance with true reason.
Fire may gain the mastery when more bodies of matter than usual have
gathered themselves up out of the infinite 3 and then its powers decay,
vanquished in some way or other, or else things perish burnt up by the
torrid air. Water too of yore gathered itself and began to get the
mastery, as the story goes, when it whelmed many cities of men 3 and
then when all that force that had gathered itself up out of the infinite,
by some means or other was turned aside and withdraw, the rains were

stayed and the rivers moderated their fury.
But in what ways yon concourse of matter founded earth and

heaven and the deeps of the sea, the courses of sun and moon, I will
next in order describe. For verily not by design did the first-begin-
nings of things station themselves each in its right place by keen-
