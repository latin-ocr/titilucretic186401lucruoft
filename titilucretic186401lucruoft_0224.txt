at bene non poterat sine puro pectore vivi,

quo magis 1110 merito nobis deus esse videtur,

ex quo nunc etiam per magnas didita gentis 20
dulcia permulcent animos solacia vitae.

Herculis antistare autem si facta putabis»,

longius a vera multo ratione ferere.

quid Nemeaeus enim nobis nunc magnus hiatus

ille leonis obesset et horrens Arcadius sus? 25

denique quid Cretae taurus Lernaeaque pestis
hydra venenatis posset vallata colubris?
quidve tripectora tergemini vis Geryonai

aureaque Hesperidum servans fulgentia mala,
asper, acerba tuenS, immani corpore serpens

these sweet solaces of existence which even now are distributed over
great nations and gently soothe men’s minds. Then if you shall suppose
that the deeds of Hercules surpass his, you will be carried still farther
away from true reason. For what would yon great gaping maw of
Nemean lion now harm us and the bristled Arcadian 110312 ay or what
could the bull of Crete do and the hydra plague of Lerna, fenced round
with its envenomed snakes? or how could the triple-breasted might of
threefold Geryon, [how could the birds with brazen arrowy feathers] that
dwelt in the Stymphalian swamps do 113 such mighty injury, and the
horses of Thracian Diomede breathing fire from their nostrils along the
Bistonian borders and Ismara? and the serpent which guards the bright
golden apples of the Hesperide8‚ fierce, dangerous of aspect, girding the
tree’s stem with his enormous body, what harm pray could he do us beside
the Atlantic shore and melan choly main, which none of us goes near
and no barbarian ventures nigh2 And all other monsters of the kind
which have been destroyed, if they had not been vanquished‚ what harm

could they do, I ask, if now alive? N one methinks: the earth even ·
