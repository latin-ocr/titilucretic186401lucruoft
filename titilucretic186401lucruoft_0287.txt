Iam validis saepti degebant turribus aevom 1440

propterea quid sit prius actum respicere aetas
nostra nequit, nisi qua ratio vestigia monstrat.

seasons of the year came round and that the system was carried on after
“ a fixed plan and fixed order.

Already they would pass their life fenced about with strong towers,
and the land, portioned out and marked off by boundaries, be tilled3
the sea would be filled with ships scudding under sail, towns have
auxiliaries and allies as stipulated by treaty, when poets began to con-
sign the deeds of men -to verse ,· and letters had not been invented long
before. For this reason our age cannot look back to what has gone
before, save where reason points out any traces.

Ships and tillage walls laws arms roads dress and all such like things,
all the prizeS, all the elegancies too of life without exception, poems
pictures, and the chiselling fine-wrought statues, all these things practice
together'with the acquired knowledge of the untiring mind taught men
by slow degrees as they advanced on the way step by step. Thus time
by degrees brings each several thing forth before men’s eyes and reason

· raises them up into the borders of light3 for things must be brought to

light one after the other and in due order in the different arts, until
these have reached their highest point of development.
