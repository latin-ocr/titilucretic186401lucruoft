aut aliquo cum iam sucus de corpore cessit;

nil oculis tamen esse minor res ipsa videtur

propterea neque detractum de pondere quicquam, 225
nimirum quia multa minutaque semina sucos

efficiunt et odorem in toto corpore rerum.

quare etiam atque etiam mentis naturam animaeque

scire licet perquam pauxillis esse creatam

seminibus quoniam fugiens nil ponderis aufert. 230

N 66 tamen 11666 simplex nobis natura putanda est..

tenvis enim quaedam moribundos deserit aura

mixta vapore, vapor porro trahit aera secum.

1166 66101 681 quisquam, 6111 11011 811 mixtus 613 661;

1616 quod eius enim constat natura, necessest 235

iam triplex animi est igitur natura reperta3

nec tamen haec 8613 811111 ad sensum cuncta creandum,

nil horum quoniam recepit res posse creare

sensiferos motus et homo quae mente volutat. 240
Δ quarta quoque his igitur quaedam natura necessest

qua neque mobilius quicquam neque tenvius exstat,

savour has left some body, yet 1116 thing itself does not look smaller 10
the eye, nor does aught seem to have been taken from 1116 weight, be-
cause 81116 enough many minute seeds make up the savours aud the
odour in the whole body of the several things. Therefore‚ again and
again Ι say, you are 10 know that the nature of the mind and the soul
has been formed of exceedingly minute seeds, since at its departure it
takes away none of the weight.

We are not however 10 suppose that this 11611116 18 single. For 6
66116111 subtle spirit mixed with 116613 quits men at death, and then the
116613 draws air along with it 3 there being no 116613 which has not air 100
mixed with it x for since its nature is rare, many first-beginnings of air
must move about through it. Thus then the nature of the mind 18 proved
to be threefold 3 and yet these things all together are not sufficient to
produce sense3 since „theg 1661301,1116Ν6686ψς10681101 admit that any of
these can produce sense-giving motions and the thoughts which a man

these: it 18 altogether without name3 than it nothing exists more nimble
01 more fine, or of smaller or smoother elements: it first transmits the
sense-giving motions through the frame 3 for it 18 first atil-red, made up
