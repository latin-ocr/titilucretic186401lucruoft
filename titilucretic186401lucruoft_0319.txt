est natura, fere silicum suffulta cavernis,

omnibus est porro in speluncis ventus et aer3

ventus enim fit, ubi est agitando percitus aer. 685
hic ubi percaluit calefecitque omnia circum

saxa furenS‚ qua contingit, terramque, et ab ollis
excussit calidum flammis velocibus ignem,

tollit se ac rectis ita faucibus eicit alte.

fert itaque ardorem longe longeque favillam 690

differt et crassa volvit caligine fumum

extruditque simul mirando pondere saxa 3

ne dubites quin haec animai turbida sit vis,

praeterea magna ex parti mare montis ad eius

radices frangit fluctus aestumque resorbet. 695
ex 1100 usque mari speluncae montis ad altas

perveniunt subter fauces, hac ire fatendumst

et penetrare mari penitus res cogit aperto
atque efflare foras ideoque extollere flammam
saxaque subiectare et arenae ‘tollere nimbos 700
in summo sunt vertice enim crateres ut ipsi
nominitant3 nos quod fauces perhibemus et ora.

Sunt aliquot quoque res quarum unam dicere causam

propped throughout with caverns of basalt rocks. Furthermore in all
caves are wind and air 3 for wind is produced, when the air has been
stirred and put in motion. When this air has been thoroughly heated
and raging about has imparted its heat 10 all the rocks round, wherever
it comes in contact with them, and to the earth, ancl has struck out from
them fire burning with swift flames, it rises up and then forces itself out

on high straight through the gorges3 and so carries its heat far and ,
scatters far its ashes and rolls on smoke of a thick pitchy blackness and .

flings out at the same time stones of prodigious weight3 leaving no
doubt that this is the stormy force of air. Again the sea to a great ex-
tent breaks its waves and sucks back its surf at the roots of that moun-
tain. Oaverns reach from this sea as far as the deep gorges of the
mountain below. Through these you must admit [that air mixed up
with water passes 3 and] the nature of the case compels [this air to enter
in from that] open sea and pass right within and then go out in blasts
and so lift up fiame and throw out stones and raise clouds of saud 3 for
on the summit are craters, as they name them in their own language3
what we call gorges and mouths.

There are some things too for which it is not sufficient to assign 0110
