pausa atque infestis cogei saevire querellis,

intellegit ibi vitium vas efficere ipsum

omniaque illius vitio corrumpier intus

quae conlata foris et commoda cumque venirent3

partim quod fluxum pertusumque esse videbat, 20
ut nulla posset ratione explerier umquam3

cleansed men's breasts with truth-telling precepts and fixed a limit to
lust and fear and explained what was the chief good which we all strive
to reach, and pointed out the road by which along a narrow track we
might arrive at it in a straightforward course 3 he shewed too what evils
existed in mortal affairs throughout, rising up and manifoldly flying
about by a natural—call it chance or force, because nature had so
brought it about 3 and from what gates you must sally out duly to en-
counter each 3 and he proved that mankind mostly without cause arouse
in their breast the melancholy tumbling billows of cares For even as
children are flurried and dread all things in the thick darkness, thus we·
