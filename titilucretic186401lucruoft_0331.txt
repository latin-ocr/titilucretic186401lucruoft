from our whole body3 the beard grows and hairs over all our limbs and
frame. Food is distributed through all the veins‚ gives increase and
nourishment to the very extremities and nails. We feel too cold and
heat pass through brass, we feel them pass through gold and silver‚ when
we hold full cups. Again voices fly through the stone partitions of
houses3 smell passes through and cold and the heat of fire, which is
wont ay to pierce even the strength of iron, where the Gaulish cuirass
girds the body round. And storms that have gathered in earth and
heaven with good right withdraw and take their departure respectively
to heaven and earth, and along with them the influence of disease‚ when
it makes its way in from without3 since there is nothing at all that is
not of a rare texture of body.

Furthermore all bodies whatever which are discharged from things
are not qualified to excite the same sensations nor are adapted for all
things alike. The sun for instance bakes and dries up the earth, but
thaws ice, and forces the snows piled up high on the high hills to melt
away beneath his rays; wax again turns to liquid when placed within
reach of his heat. Fire also melts brass and fuses gold, but· shrivels up
