perque volare mare ac terras caelumque rigare,
quid quae sunt igitur iam prima fronte parata,
205 cum iaciuntur et emissum res nulla moratur,
195 quod superest, ubi tam volucri levitate ferantur? 205
206 quone vides citius debere et longius ire
multiplexque loci spatium transcurrere eodem
tempore quo solis pervolgant lumina caelum?
hoc etiam in primis specimen verum esse videtur
quam celeri motu rerum simulacra ferantur, 210
quod simul ac primum sub diu splendor aquai
ponitur, extemplo caelo stellante serena
sidera respondent in aqua radiantia mundi.
iamne vides igitur quam puncto tempore imago
aetheris ex oris in terrarum accidat oras? 215
quare etiam atque etiam mira fateare necessest

corpora quae feriant oculos visumque lacessant.
perpetuoque fluunt certis ab rebus odores;

frigus ut a fluviis, calor ab sole, aestus ab undis
aequoris exesor moerorum litora circum. 220
nec variae cessant voces volitare per auras,

denique in os salsi venit umor saepe saporiS,

length and breadth of heaven, fly over sea and lands and flood the heaven,
what then of those which stand ready posted in front rank, when they
are discharged and nothing obstructs their egress, where moreover they
are borne on with such winged rapidity‘l do you not see how much
faster and farther they must travel‚ scouring through many times the
same amount of space in the same time that the sunlight takes to spread
over heaven? This too appears to be an eminently true proof of the
velocity with which idols of things are borne along : as soonffas ever the
brightness of water is set down in the open air, if the heaven is stan-y,
in a moment the clear radiant constellations of ether imaged in the water
correspond to those in the heaven. Now do you see in what a moment
of time an image drops down from the borders of heaven to the borders
of earth? Therefore again and again I repeat you must admit that
bodies capable of striking the eyes and of provoking sense [constantly
travel] with a marvellous [velocity]. Smells too incessantly stream from
certain things 3 as does cold from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from
the waves of the sea, that eater into walls near the shore. Various
sounds also cease not to fly through the air. Then too a moist salt
flavour often comes into the mouth, when we are moving about beside
